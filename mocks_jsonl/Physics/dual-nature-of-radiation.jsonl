The energy of a photon is given by \\(E = h\\nu\\), where \\(h\\) is Planck's constant and \\(\\nu\\) is the frequency of the light. Ultraviolet rays have higher frequencies and thus higher energies compared to microwaves and infrared rays, making them more effective for the emission of electrons from a metallic surface.\n<br><br>\nStatement II is incorrect.

The observations from the photoelectric effect led to the development of quantum theory. </p>\n<p>According to the principles of the photoelectric effect:</p>\n<p>A. The photocurrent (number of photoelectrons ejected per unit time) is indeed proportional to the intensity of the incident radiation. More intense light means more photons hitting the surface and thus more electrons being ejected.</p>\n<p>B. The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons does not depend on the intensity of the incident light but rather on its frequency. Increasing the intensity of light increases the number of photoelectrons (current) but does not increase their maximum kinetic energy. </p>\n<p>C. The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons does indeed depend on the frequency of the incident light. If the frequency of the incident light is below a certain threshold frequency specific to the metal, no photoelectrons are emitted regardless of the intensity of the light. Above this threshold, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons increases linearly with the frequency of the light.</p>\n<p>D. The emission of photoelectrons does not require a minimum threshold intensity of incident radiation, but rather a minimum threshold frequency. </p>\n<p>E. The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is not independent of the frequency of the incident light, but rather depends on it.</p>\n<p>Therefore, only statements A and C are correct.</p>","<strong>Q8:</strong> <p>When energy of incident radiation is equal to the work function of the metal, then the KE of photoelectrons would be zero.
