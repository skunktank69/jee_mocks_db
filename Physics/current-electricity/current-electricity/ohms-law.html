<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c10">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p><strong>Assertion (A):</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A choke coil is simply a coil having large inductance but small resistance.  </p>
<p>Choke coils are used with fluorescent mercury-tube fittings.  </p>
<p>If household electric power is directly connected to a mercury tube, the tube will be damaged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>A choke (or ballast) <strong>does</strong> have high inductance and low resistance.  </p></p>
<p><p>In a fluorescent lamp (or mercury‐vapor lamp) circuit, the choke limits the <strong>current</strong> through the tube.  </p></p>
<p><p>If we connect the tube directly to the full line voltage <strong>without</strong> any current-limiting device, excessive current will flow and damage the tube.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>(A) is true</strong>.</p></p>
<p><strong>Reason (R):</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>By using the choke coil, the voltage across the tube is reduced by a factor  </p>
<p>\(\displaystyle \frac{R}{\sqrt{R^2 + (\omega L)^2}}\),  </p>
<p>where \(\omega\) is the supply frequency, and \(R\) and \(L\) are the resistance and inductance in series.  </p>
<p>If the choke coil were not used, the voltage across the resistor (tube) would be the same as the applied voltage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>In a simple <strong>series R–L</strong> circuit (where \(R\) represents the lamp’s effective resistance once conducting, and \(L\) is the choke’s inductance), the total impedance is  </p>
<p>\(        Z = \sqrt{\,R^2 + (\omega L)^2\,}.      \)  </p></p>
<p><p>The current is the same through \(R\) and \(L\). The fraction of the <strong>total supply voltage</strong> appearing across \(R\) alone is  </p>
<p>\(        \frac{V_R}{V_{\text{total}}} \;=\; \frac{I\,R}{I\,Z} \;=\; \frac{R}{\sqrt{R^2 + (\omega L)^2}}.      \)  </p></p>
<p><p>This shows that using a large inductance \(L\) (the choke) can substantially reduce (or limit) the voltage—and hence the current—through the lamp.  </p></p>
<p><p>Without the choke coil, the tube (treated here as a resistor once it starts conducting) would indeed see nearly the <strong>full line voltage</strong>, causing a large current that could destroy it.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>(R) is also true</strong>. </p></p>
<p><strong>Does (R) correctly explain (A)?</strong> </p>
<p><p>(A) states <em>why</em> a choke coil is needed (to prevent the lamp from being damaged by excessive current).  </p></p>
<p><p>(R) shows <em>how</em> the choke coil limits the voltage/current through the lamp—by giving the fraction of the supply voltage that appears across the lamp in a series R–L circuit.  </p></p>
<p><p>Thus, (R) <strong>does</strong> provide the correct (physics-based) explanation: the choke’s inductive reactance drops a significant portion of the supply voltage, thereby protecting the lamp.</p></p>
<p>Hence, the correct option is:</p>
<p>\( \boxed{\text{Option B: Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is the correct explanation of (A).}} \)</p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> \(m=8.92 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg}\)
<br/><br/>
Density \(=8.92 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}\)
<br/><br/>
Volume \(=\frac{8.92 \times 10^{-3}}{8.92 \times 10^{3}}=\left(10^{-6}\right) \mathrm{m}^{3}\)
<br/><br/>
Resistance \(=\frac{3.4}{2}=1.7 \Omega=\left(\frac{\rho l}{A}\right)\)
<br/><br/>
\(1.7=\frac{\rho l^{2}}{(A l)}\)
<br/><br/>
\(\Rightarrow 1.7=\frac{1.7 \times 10^{-8} \times l^{2}}{10^{-6}}\)
<br/><br/>
\(l^2=100\)
<br/><br/>
\(l=10 \mathrm{~m}\)</li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> <p>Resistance \( = \tan 45^\circ  = 1\,\Omega \)</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow 1 = {{pI} \over A}\)</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow p = {{\pi {{(1.2\,cm)}^2}} \over {31.4\,cm}} = 1.44 \times {10^{ - 1}}\) \(\Omega\) cm</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow x = 144\)</p></li>
