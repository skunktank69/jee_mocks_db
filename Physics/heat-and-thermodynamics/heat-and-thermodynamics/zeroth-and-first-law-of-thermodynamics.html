<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p><p><strong>Check Statement (A)</strong>:  </p>
<p>“Internal energy (U), volume (V), and mass (M) are extensive variables.”  </p></p>
<p><p><strong>Internal energy</strong> is extensive.  </p></p>
<p><p><strong>Volume</strong> is extensive.  </p></p>
<p><p><strong>Mass</strong> is extensive.  </p>
<p>Hence, statement (A) is <strong>correct</strong>.</p></p>
<p><p><strong>Check Statement (B)</strong>:  </p>
<p>“Pressure (P), temperature (T), and density (ρ) are intensive variables.”  </p></p>
<p><p><strong>Pressure</strong> is intensive.  </p></p>
<p><p><strong>Temperature</strong> is intensive.  </p></p>
<p><p><strong>Density</strong> is intensive.  </p>
<p>Hence, statement (B) is <strong>correct</strong>.</p></p>
<p><p><strong>Check Statement (C)</strong>:  </p>
<p>“Volume (V), temperature (T), and density (ρ) are intensive variables.”  </p></p>
<p><p><strong>Volume</strong> is <strong>not</strong> intensive; it is an extensive property.  </p></p>
<p><p>(T) and (ρ) are indeed intensive.  </p>
<p>Since volume is miscategorized here, (C) is <strong>incorrect</strong>.</p></p>
<p><p><strong>Check Statement (D)</strong>:  </p>
<p>“Mass (M), temperature (T), and internal energy are extensive variables.”  </p></p>
<p><p><strong>Mass</strong> is extensive.  </p></p>
<p><p><strong>Temperature</strong> is <strong>not</strong> extensive (it is intensive).  </p></p>
<p><p><strong>Internal energy</strong> is extensive.  </p>
<p>Because temperature is miscategorized, (D) is <strong>incorrect</strong>.</p></p>
<p>Only <strong>(A)</strong> and <strong>(B)</strong> are correct statements. </p>
<p>Therefore, the correct choice is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Option B: (A) and (B) Only.</strong></p>
</blockquote></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> Heat supplied to the system \(=d Q\) 
<br/><br/>Work done on the system \(=-d W\) 
<br/><br/>By the first law of thermodynamics, \(d Q=d U+d W\) 
<br/><br/>We done the work, therefore,
<br/><br/>\(
d Q=d U+(-d W) = d U-d W
\)
<br/><br/>So, both A and R are correct and R is the correct explanation
of A.</li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> <p>The rate of increase of internal energy of a system can be found using the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system. </p>
<p>In this case, the heat being supplied to the system is 1000 W and the work being done by the system is 200 W. </p>
<p>Therefore, the rate at which the internal energy of the system increases is:</p>
<p>1000 W (heat supplied) - 200 W (work done) = 800 W</p>
<p>So, the correct answer is 800 W.</p>

<li>Q1: <strong>C</strong></li><li>Q2: <strong>A</strong></li><li>Q3: <strong>C</strong></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c10">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p>During the melting of a slab of ice at 273 K under atmospheric pressure, the following occurs:</p>
<p>As the ice melts, its volume decreases. Because of this volume reduction, the atmosphere exerts a positive work on the ice-water system. When heat is absorbed by the ice-water system, we denote the absorbed heat as \( \Delta \mathrm{Q} \), which is positive. The work done by the ice-water system is negative because it is being compressed by the external pressure.</p>
<p>According to the first law of thermodynamics:</p>
<p>\( \Delta \mathrm{U} = \Delta \mathrm{Q} + \Delta \mathrm{W} \)</p>
<p>In this equation, \( \Delta \mathrm{U} \) represents the change in internal energy, \( \Delta \mathrm{Q} \) is the heat absorbed by the system, and \( \Delta \mathrm{W} \) is the work done by the system. Since the work done is negative and the absorbed heat is positive, the overall internal energy (\( \Delta \mathrm{U} \)) increases.</p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> <p>To find the change in internal energy, we need to consider both the heat added during the process and the work done during the process.</p>
<p>First, let's calculate the heat added (\(Q\)) to convert 1 kg of water at 100°C into steam at 100°C using the latent heat of vaporization:</p>
<p>\(Q = m \times L\)</p>
<p>where \(m = 1 \mathrm{~kg}\) and \(L = 2257 \mathrm{~kJ/kg}\):</p>
<p>\(Q = 1 \mathrm{~kg} \times 2257 \mathrm{~kJ/kg} = 2257 \mathrm{~kJ}\)</p>
<p>Next, let's calculate the work done (\(W\)) on the system during the process. The work done is given by:</p>
<p>\(W = -P \Delta V\)</p>
<p>where \(P\) is the atmospheric pressure and \(\Delta V\) is the change in volume. We are given that the atmospheric pressure is \(P = 1 \times 10^5 \mathrm{~Pa}\), and the change in volume is<br/><br/> \(\Delta V = 1.671 \mathrm{~m}^3 - 1.00 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}^3 = 1.670 \mathrm{~m}^3\).</p>
<p>Now, we can calculate the work done:</p>
<p>\(W = -(1 \times 10^5 \mathrm{~Pa})(1.670 \mathrm{~m}^3) = -167000 \mathrm{~J} = -167 \mathrm{~kJ}\)</p>
<p>Finally, we can find the change in internal energy (\(\Delta U\)) using the first law of thermodynamics:</p>
<p>\(\Delta U = Q + W\)</p>
<p>Substitute the values of \(Q\) and \(W\):</p>
<p>\(\Delta U = 2257 \mathrm{~kJ} - 167 \mathrm{~kJ} = 2090 \mathrm{~kJ}\)</p>
<p>The change in internal energy of the system during the process is +2090 kJ. </p>
</li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> <p>An adiabatic process is one in which there is no heat exchange between a system (in this case, the gas) and its surroundings. This happens because the system is perfectly insulated or the process occurs very quickly, not allowing for heat exchange. </p>
<p>Given the options:</p>
<p><b>Option A</b>: There is no heat supplied to the system. </p>
<ul>
<li>This statement is TRUE. In an adiabatic process, there is no heat exchange between the system and its surroundings, as mentioned above.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Option B</b>: The temperature of the gas increases.</p>
<ul>
<li>This statement is TRUE. When a gas is compressed adiabatically, the work done on the gas increases its internal energy, which in turn increases the temperature of the gas.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Option C</b>: There is no change in the internal energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>This statement is NOT TRUE. In an adiabatic process, the change in internal energy of the system is equal to the work done on the system. When the gas is compressed, work is done on the gas, which increases its internal energy.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Option D</b>: The change in the internal energy is equal to the work done on the gas.</p>
<ul>
<li>This statement is TRUE. As mentioned above, in an adiabatic process, the change in internal energy of the system is equal to the work done on the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, Option C is the statement that is not true for an adiabatic process.</p>
</li>
