<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c10">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <strong>1. Center of Mass Coordinates:</strong>
<p>The center of mass (COM) of a system of particles is calculated as:</p>
<p>\(X_{COM} = \frac{\sum_{i} m_i x_i}{\sum_{i} m_i}\)</p>
<p>\(Y_{COM} = \frac{\sum_{i} m_i y_i}{\sum_{i} m_i} \(\)</p>
<p>where \(m_i\) is the mass of the \(i\)-th particle, and \((x_i, y_i)\) are its coordinates.</p>
<strong>2. Coordinate Setup:</strong>
<p>Let's place the origin at the right angle of the triangle and align the sides along the x and y axes:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Sphere 1: \((4, 0)\)</li><br/>
<li>Sphere 2: \((0, 4)\)</li><br/>
<li>Sphere 3: \((0, 0)\)</li>
</ul></p>
<strong>3. Calculations:</strong>
<p>Since all spheres have mass \(2M\), we can simplify the COM calculations:</p>
<p>\)X_{COM} = \frac{2M \cdot 4 + 2M \cdot 0 + 2M \cdot 0} {2M + 2M + 2M} = \frac{4}{3}\(</p>
<p>\)Y_{COM} = \frac{2M \cdot 0 + 2M \cdot 4 + 2M \cdot 0} {2M + 2M + 2M} = \frac{4}{3}\(</p>
<strong>4. Magnitude of Position Vector:</strong>
<p>The position vector of the COM is \(\left(\frac{4}{3}, \frac{4}{3}\right)\).  Its magnitude is:</p>
<p>\)|\vec{r}_{COM}| = \sqrt{\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^2} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3}$\(</p>
<strong>5. Finding x:</strong>
<p>We are given that the magnitude of the position vector is of the form \)\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{x}\(. Comparing this to our result, we find that \)x = 3\(.</p>
<strong>Answer:</strong>
<p>The value of \)x$ is 3.</p>
<p></p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> <p>To solve this problem, we can make use of the concept of center of mass. The center of mass (CM) of a system remains unchanged if the internal forces act within the system without any external force. When one mass moves toward the CM, to keep the CM at the same position, the other mass must move in a way that the product of each mass with its displacement relative to the CM remains constant.</p>
<p>The formula to ensure that the center of mass remains unchanged can be derived from the principle of conservation of momentum or simply by understanding that the weighted average position (considering masses as weights) does not change.</p>
<p>Let's denote:
- \(x_1\) as the distance moved by \(m_1\) towards the CM,
- \(x_2\) as the distance \(m_2\) needs to move towards the CM,
- The total mass of the system as \(M = m_1 + m_2\).</p>
<p>Since \(m_1\) moves towards the CM by 2 cm, we apply the principle that the weighted sum of displacements (taking mass into account) remains 0 to maintain the center of mass at its original position:</p>
<p>\(m_1 \cdot x_1 + m_2 \cdot x_2 = 0\)</p>
<p>Given that \(m_1 = 3 \, \text{kg}\), \(m_2 = 2 \, \text{kg}\), and \(x_1 = 2 \, \text{cm}\), we substitute these values into the equation:</p>
<p>\(3 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot x_2 = 0\)</p>
<p>Solving for \(x_2\) gives:</p>
<p>\(6 + 2x_2 = 0\)</p>
<p>\(2x_2 = -6\)</p>
<p>\(x_2 = -3 \, \text{cm}\)</p>
<p>This means the mass \(m_2\) should move \(3 \, \mathrm{cm}\) towards the center of mass to keep the center of mass of the system at the original position. The negative sign indicates the direction is towards the center of mass, similar to \(m_1\)'s movement direction in relation to keeping the CM stationary.</p></li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> <p>For COM to remain unchanged,</p>
<p>m<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> = m<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>\(\Rightarrow\) 10 \(\times\) 6 = 30 \(\times\) x<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>\(\Rightarrow\) x<sub>2</sub> = 2 cm towards 10 kg block.</p></li><li><strong>Q4:</strong> <p><img alt="JEE Main 2022 (Online) 25th July Evening Shift Physics - Center of Mass and Collision Question 36 English Explanation" data-orsrc="https://app-content.cdn.examgoal.net/image/1l6ummxzq/f571ac43-99e4-45d3-856a-a0bab6271d11/f49d5360-1c86-11ed-b633-f353ad3cb8e4/file-1l6ummxzr.png" loading="lazy" src="https://app-content.cdn.examgoal.net/fly/@width/image/1l6ummxzq/f571ac43-99e4-45d3-856a-a0bab6271d11/f49d5360-1c86-11ed-b633-f353ad3cb8e4/file-1l6ummxzr.png?format=png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0px auto; max-height: 40vh;"/></p>
