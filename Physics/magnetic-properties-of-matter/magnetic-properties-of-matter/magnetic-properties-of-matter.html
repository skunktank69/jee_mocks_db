<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c10">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p>Paramagnetic substances exhibit specific characteristics in the presence of an external magnetic field. Understanding these characteristics will help us choose the most appropriate answer. Let's discuss each statement individually:</p>
<p><strong>A. align themselves along the directions of external magnetic field.</strong><br/>
This is true. Paramagnetic substances have unpaired electrons, and under the influence of an external magnetic field, the atomic dipoles (due to those unpaired electrons) tend to align themselves in the direction of the magnetic field.</p>
<p><strong>B. attract strongly towards external magnetic field.</strong><br/>
This statement is the cause of some confusion. Paramagnetic substances are attracted towards an external magnetic field, but the keyword here is <i>strongly</i>. Compared to ferromagnetic substances, the attraction is relatively weak. Given the context of the options provided, saying they are "strongly" attracted could be misleading, but it is undeniable they are attracted nevertheless.</p>
<p><strong>C. has susceptibility little more than zero.</strong><br/>
This is correct. The magnetic susceptibility of paramagnetic materials is positive, meaning they are attracted to magnetic fields, but it is small in magnitude, typically greater than zero but far less than the susceptibility of ferromagnetic materials.</p>
<p><strong>D. move from a region of strong magnetic field to weak magnetic field.</strong><br/>
This statement is incorrect for paramagnetic substances. They are attracted to magnetic fields, implying they move from a region of weaker magnetic field to a stronger magnetic field, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Taking these points into account, the most accurate answer would be:</p>
<p><strong>Options B: A, C Only</strong><br/>
A) They indeed align along the direction of an external magnetic field, and C) Their susceptibility is indeed a little more than zero, indicating a weak attraction to magnetic fields. Statement B can be considered incorrect not in its entirety that they are attracted, but in the use of the term "strongly," and D is certainly incorrect regarding their movement in magnetic fields.</p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> <b>Statement I</b> : The diamagnetic property depends on temperature.
This statement is incorrect. Diamagnetism is an intrinsic property of materials that arises due to the presence of completely filled electron shells. It does not depend on temperature.
<br><br>
<b>Statement II</b> : The induced magnetic dipole moment in a diamagnetic sample is always opposite to the magnetizing field.
This statement is true. Diamagnetic materials have a negative magnetic susceptibility, which means that they oppose the applied magnetic field. This results in the induced magnetic dipole moment being always opposite to the magnetizing field.</br></br></li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> <p>Both Statement I and Statement II are true. </p>
<p><b>Statement I</b>: For diamagnetic substances, the magnetic susceptibility (χ) lies between -1 and 0. This is because diamagnetic substances have a negative magnetic susceptibility, which means they have a tendency to oppose the applied magnetic field.</p>
<p><b>Statement II</b>: Diamagnetic substances, when placed in an external magnetic field, experience a force that tends to move them from stronger to weaker parts of the field. This is due to the fact that diamagnetic substances oppose the applied magnetic field and try to minimize their exposure to it.</p>
</li><li><strong>Q4:</strong> <p>Statement I is true as susceptibility of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic materials is inversely related to temperature.</p>
<p>Statement II is true as because of orbital motion of electrons the diamagnetic material is able to oppose external magnetic field.</p></li>

</ol>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c10">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p>The percentage change in the magnetic field (B) when the space within a current-carrying solenoid is filled with magnesium is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>We start by using the formula for percentage change in the magnetic field:</p>
<p>\( \% \text{ change in } B = \frac{B_{\text{new}} - B_{\text{old}}}{B_{\text{old}}} \times 100\% \)</p>
<p>Substituting the expressions for the magnetic field, we have:</p>
<p>\( = \frac{\mu n i - \mu_0 n i}{\mu_0 n i} \times 100\% = \frac{\mu - \mu_0}{\mu_0} \times 100\% \)</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p><p>\(\mu\) is the permeability of the material inserted (here, magnesium).</p></p>
<p><p>\(\mu_0\) is the permeability of free space.</p></p>
<p><p>\(n\) is the number of turns per unit length of the solenoid.</p></p>
<p><p>\(i\) is the current through the solenoid.</p></p>
<p>Given that the relationship between the permeability of the medium (\(\mu\)) and relative permeability (\(\mu_r\)) is:</p>
<p>\( \mu = \mu_0 \mu_r \)</p>
<p>We can simplify this to:</p>
<p>\( = \frac{\mu_0 \mu_r - \mu_0}{\mu_0} \times 100\% \)</p>
<p>Which reduces to:</p>
<p>\( = (\mu_r - 1) \times 100\% \)</p>
<p>The relative permeability \(\mu_r\) is equal to \(1 + \chi\), where \(\chi\) is the magnetic susceptibility. Thus, we have:</p>
<p>\( = \chi \times 100\% \)</p>
<p>When magnesium is used, with a magnetic susceptibility \(\chi_{\text{Mg}} = 1.2 \times 10^{-5}\), the calculation becomes:</p>
<p>\( = 1.2 \times 10^{-5} \times 100\% = 1.2 \times 10^{-3}\% \)</p>
<p>Therefore, the percentage increase in the magnetic field when the solenoid is filled with magnesium is \(1.2 \times 10^{-3}\%\).</p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> The magnetic susceptibility (\(\chi_m\)) of a material is the measure of how much the material becomes magnetized in response to an external magnetic field. When the material is placed in a magnetic field, the net magnetic field (\(B\)) inside the material is the sum of the external magnetic field (\(B_0\)) and the field produced by the material itself (\(B_{material}\)). This relationship can be expressed as :
<br><br>
\(B = B_0 + B_{material}\)
<br><br/>
Magnetic susceptibility is related to the relative permeability (\(\mu_r\)) of the material :
<br/><br/>
\(\mu_r = 1 + \chi_m\)
<br/><br/>
The magnetic field inside the toroid can be calculated using the following formula :
<br/><br/>
\(B = \mu_0 \mu_r H\)
<br/><br/>
where \(\mu_0\) is the permeability of free space, \(\mu_r\) is the relative permeability of the material, and \(H\) is the magnetic field strength. 
<br/><br/>
Now, let's consider the percentage increase in the magnetic field when the material is placed inside the toroid. The initial magnetic field (\(B_0\)) is given by :
<br/><br/>
\(B_0 = \mu_0 H\)
<br/><br/>
After the material is placed inside the toroid, the magnetic field becomes :
<br/><br/>
\(B = \mu_0 \mu_r H = \mu_0 (1 + \chi_m) H\)
<br/><br/>
The percentage increase in the magnetic field can be calculated as :
<br/><br/>
\(\frac{B - B_0}{B_0} \times 100\% = \frac{\mu_0 (1 + \chi_m) H - \mu_0 H}{\mu_0 H} \times 100\%\)
<br/><br/>
Substitute the value of \(\chi_m = 2 \times 10^{-2}\) :
<br/><br/>
\(\frac{B - B_0}{B_0} \times 100\% = \frac{(1 + 2 \times 10^{-2}) - 1}{1} \times 100\% = 2\%\)
<br/><br/>
Thus, the percentage increase in the value of the magnetic field inside the toroid is 2%.</br></br></br></li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> <p>\(\overrightarrow {B'}  = {\mu _0}(1 + X)ni\) (in the material)</p>
<p>\(\overrightarrow {B'}  = {\mu _0}ni\) (without material)</p>
<p>So fractional increase is</p>
<p>\({{B' - B} \over B} = X = 1.2 \times {10^{ - 5}}\)</p></li>

</ol>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c10">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p>Coercivity is a measure of the resistance of a ferromagnetic material to becoming demagnetized. It is defined as the intensity of the applied magnetic field required to reduce the magnetization of a material to zero after the magnetization of the sample has been driven to saturation. In this case, coercivity \(H_c\) is given to be \(5 \times 10^3 \mathrm{~A/m}\).</p>
<p>The relationship between the magnetic field \(H\) inside a solenoid and the current \(I\) passed through it is given by the formula:</p>
<p>\(H = \frac{N \cdot I}{L}\)</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(H\) is the magnetic field strength inside the solenoid in amperes per meter (A/m),</li>
<li>\(N\) is the total number of turns of wire,</li>
<li>\(I\) is the current in amperes (A), and</li>
<li>\(L\) is the length of the solenoid in meters (m).</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that the number of turns of the solenoid \(N = 150\) and the length of the solenoid \(L = 30 \, \text{cm} = 0.3 \, \text{m}\), we can rearrange the formula to solve for \(I\):</p>
<p>\(I = \frac{H \cdot L}{N}\)</p>
<p>Substituting the given values:</p>
<p>\(I = \frac{(5 \times 10^3) \times 0.3}{150}\)</p>
<p>Simplifying, we get:</p>
<p>\(I = \frac{1500}{150}\)</p>
<p>\(I = 10 \, \text{A}\)</p>
<p>Therefore, the amount of current required to be passed in the solenoid for demagnetizing the magnet when inside the solenoid is <strong>10 A</strong>.</p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> Number of turns per unit length \(=\frac{1200}{2}=600\)
<br/><br/>
So, Magnetic Intensity \(H=n I\)
<br/><br/>
\(
\begin{aligned}
&amp; =600 \times 2 ~\mathrm{Am}^{-1} \\\\
&amp; =1200 ~\mathrm{Am}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
\)</li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> <p>We know that the magnetizing field (H) inside a solenoid is given by the formula :</p>
<p>\( H = \frac{N \cdot I}{L} \)</p>
<p>where (N) is the number of turns, (I) is the current in Amperes, and (L) is the length of the solenoid in meters.</p>
<p>To demagnetize a bar magnet that has a magnetic intensity (H) of (\(2.4 \times 10^3 \, \text{Am}^{-1}\)), you need to create a magnetizing field in the solenoid that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.</p>
<p>Given:</p>
<ul>
<li>(\(H = 2.4 \times 10^3 \, \text{Am}^{-1}\))</li>
<li>(N = 60) turns</li>
<li>(\(L = 15 \, \text{cm} = 0.15 \, \text{m}\)) (since \((1\, \text{m} = 100 \, \text{cm})\))</li>
</ul>
<p>You can rearrange the formula for (H) to solve for (I) :</p>
<p>\( I = \frac{H \cdot L}{N} \)</p>
<p>Substituting the given values, you get :</p>
<p>\( I = \frac{(2.4 \times 10^3 \, \text{Am}^{-1}) \cdot 0.15 \, \text{m}}{60} \)</p>
<p>\( I = 6 \, \text{Amperes} \)</p>
<p>So, the current required to be passed through the solenoid to demagnetize the bar magnet is (6 \(\, \text{A}\)).</p>
</li><li><strong>Q4:</strong> <p>In a solenoid, the magnetic field intensity (\(H\)) is given by the product of the number of turns per unit length (\(n\)) and the current (\(I\)) flowing through the solenoid. This can be represented mathematically as:</p>
<p>\(H = nI\)</p>
<p>This is actually derived from Ampere's law applied to the special case of a solenoid, where the magnetic field is uniform and directed along the axis of the solenoid.</p>
<p>If we rearrange this equation to solve for the current (\(I\)), we get:</p>
<p>\(I = \frac{H}{n}\)</p>
<p>In this problem, we're given that the magnetic field intensity (\(H\)) at the center of the solenoid is \(1.6 \times 10^{3} \, \text{Am}^{-1}\) and the number of turns per unit length (\(n\)) is 8 per cm (which is equal to \(8 \times 10^{-2}\) per meter, as there are 100 cm in a meter).</p>
<p>Substituting these values into the equation gives:</p>
<p>\(I = \frac{1.6 \times 10^{3} \, \text{Am}^{-1}}{8 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{turns/m}} = 2 \, \text{A}\)</p>
<p>So, the current flowing through the solenoid is \(2 \, \text{A}\).</p>

<h4>Answer Key</h4>
<ol class="c9" style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>Q1: <strong>A</strong></li><li>Q2: <strong>A</strong></li><li>Q3: <strong>3.5</strong></li><li>Q4: <strong>B</strong></li><li>Q5: <strong>A</strong></li><li>Q6: <strong>C</strong></li><li>Q7: <strong>C</strong></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c10">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p>(A) The unit "gauss" is used to measure magnetic induction, also known as magnetic flux density, within the CGS system of units.</p>
<p>\(B = {\phi  \over A} = {{\max well} \over {c{m^2}}} = gauss\,(CGS)\)</p>
<p>(B) Magnetic intensity (H) is defined as the product of the number of turns per unit length in a coil (n) and the current that it carries (I).</p>
<p>i.e. \(H = nI = {N \over L}I\)</p>
<p>Unit : A/m or Am\(^{-1}\)</p>
<p>(C) Magnetic flux, \(\phi  = BA\)</p>
<p>unit : weber</p>
<p>(D) Magnetic moment (M) : magnetic moment of a current loop, \(M = NIA\)</p>
<p>where, N = number of turns</p>
<p>I = current</p>
<p>A = Area</p>
<p>So, unit = Am\(^2\)</p>
<p>Hence, option A is correct.</p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> <p>The relationship between magnetic susceptibility \((\chi)\) and magnetic permeability \((\mu)\) is expressed as follows:</p>
<p><p><strong>Relative Permeability (\(\mu_r\))</strong>: This is defined as the ratio of the permeability of a material (\(\mu\)) to the permeability of free space (\(\mu_0\)).</p>
<p>\(    \mu = \mu_0 \mu_r \Rightarrow \mu_r = \frac{\mu}{\mu_0}    \)</p></p>
<p><p><strong>Magnetic Susceptibility (\(\chi\))</strong>: This relates to relative permeability as follows:</p>
<p>\(    \mu_r = 1 + \chi \Rightarrow \chi = \mu_r - 1    \)</p>
<p>Substituting the expression for \(\mu_r\) from above:</p>
<p>\(    \chi = \left(\frac{\mu}{\mu_0} - 1\right)    \)</p></p>
<p>Thus, the equation shows how magnetic susceptibility is derived from the magnetic permeability relative to free space.</p></li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> <p>\(\begin{aligned}
&amp; B_H=3.5 \times 10^{-5} T \\
&amp; F=i \ell B \sin \theta, \quad \mathrm{i}=\sqrt{2} \mathrm{~A} \\
&amp; \frac{F}{\ell}=i B \sin \theta=\sqrt{2} \times 3.5 \times 10^{-5} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&amp; =35 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}
\end{aligned}\)</p></li><li><strong>Q4:</strong> <p>In para and dia materials, susceptibility is independent of magnetic field.</p>
<p>Inside a current carrying wire, \(B \propto X\)</p>
<p>Outside a current carrying wire, \(B \propto \frac{1}{x}\)</p>
<p>Inside a solenoid, B is constant upto ends.</p></li><li><strong>Q5:</strong> <p><b>Both Assertion A and Reason R are correct, and R is indeed the correct explanation of A.</b> </p>
<p>Electromagnets are commonly made of soft iron because of its high permeability, which allows it to easily magnetize in response to an external magnetic field. Its low retentivity is also desirable because it allows the magnetization to be easily reversed or removed once the external field is removed. This combination of properties makes soft iron ideal for electromagnets, which require rapid and efficient changes in magnetization.</p>
</li><li><strong>Q6:</strong> <p>\(\mu\)<sub>r</sub> = x  + 1</p>
<p>= 99 + 1 = 100</p>
<p>\(\Rightarrow\) \(\mu\) = \(\mu\)<sub>r</sub>\(\mu\)<sub>0</sub> = 100 \(\times\) 4\(\mu\) \(\times\) 10<sup>\(-\)7</sup> Wb/Am</p>
<p>= 4\(\mu\) \(\times\) 10<sup>\(-\)5</sup> Wb/Am</p></li><li><strong>Q7:</strong> <p>Electromagnet requires high permeability and low retentivity.</p></li>
