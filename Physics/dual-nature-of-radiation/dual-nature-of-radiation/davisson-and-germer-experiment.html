<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c10">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p>The assertion A and the reason R are both correct statements, and the reason R is the correct explanation of the assertion A.</p>
<p><b>Explanation :</b></p>
<p>The assertion A states that the beam of electrons exhibit wave nature and show interference and diffraction. This statement is correct because electrons exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behavior. When electrons are accelerated to high speeds, they have a wavelength associated with them, and this wavelength can interfere and diffract just like any other wave.</p>
<p>The reason R states that the wave nature of electrons was experimentally verified by Davisson Germer. This statement is also correct because Davisson and Germer performed an experiment in 1927 where they observed diffraction patterns in a beam of electrons that were scattered off a nickel crystal. This observation provided strong evidence for the wave nature of electrons.
</p>
<p>Therefore, both assertion A and reason R are correct statements, and reason R is the correct explanation of assertion A.</p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> <p>Davisson-Germer experiment is done and establishes the wave nature of electrons. Interference and diffraction establishes wave nature.</p></li>
