</ol>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c10">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p><strong>Assertion (A)</strong> is <strong>true</strong> because a sufficiently negative potential can repel and stop the emitted electrons from leaving the surface.  </p>
<p><p><strong>Reason (R)</strong> is <strong>also true</strong> because the stopping potential \(V_{\text{stop}}\) varies linearly with the frequency \(\nu\) of the incident light (\(V_{\text{stop}} = \frac{h}{e}\,\nu - \frac{\phi}{e}\)).  </p></p>
<p><p>However, (R) does <strong>not</strong> directly explain <strong>why</strong> a negative potential suppresses electron emission; it only shows <strong>how much</strong> potential is needed for different frequencies.</p></p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>both (A) and (R) are true, but (R) is not the correct explanation of (A)</strong>.</p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> <p>In the photoelectric effect, the stopping potential (\(V_s\)) is determined by the equation:</p>
<p>\( V_s = \frac{hv - \phi}{e} \)</p>
<p>where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( v \) is the frequency of the incident light, \( \phi \) is the work function of the material, and \( e \) is the charge of the electron. This shows that the stopping potential depends on the frequency of the incident light and the work function, not on the intensity of the light.</p>
<p>The intensity of light (\( I \)) affects the number of photons hitting the surface per second, given by:</p>
<p>\( I = \frac{\eta hv}{A} \)</p>
<p>where \( \eta \) is the efficiency of photoelectron emission and \( A \) is the area. Increasing the intensity increases the number of photons per second (\( n \)), which in turn increases the number of emitted electrons. However, the stopping potential remains unaffected by changes in intensity; it is solely influenced by the frequency of the incident light relative to the work function of the material.</p></li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> <p>In order to determine the most appropriate answer to the question, let's analyze the given Assertion A and Reason R in detail.</p>
<p><strong>Assertion A:</strong> Number of photons increases with increase in frequency of light.</p>
<p>This statement is not correct. The number of photons is determined by the intensity (or power) of the light and is given by the formula:</p>
<p>\(N = \frac{P}{hf}\)</p>
<p>where \(N\) is the number of photons per second, \(P\) is the power (intensity) of the light, \(h\) is Planck's constant, and \(f\) is the frequency of the light. As the frequency increases, the energy per photon increases, but it does not necessarily mean that the number of photons increases unless the power of the light also increases proportionally.</p>
<p><strong>Reason R:</strong> Maximum kinetic energy of emitted electrons increases with the frequency of incident radiation.</p>
<p>This statement is correct. According to the photoelectric effect, the maximum kinetic energy of emitted electrons is given by:</p>
<p>\(K.E_{\text{max}} = hf - \phi\)</p>
<p>where \(K.E_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons, \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(f\) is the frequency of the incident radiation, and \(\phi\) is the work function of the material. As the frequency of the incident light increases, the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons increases.</p>
<p>Now, let's match the statements with the options given:</p>
<p><strong>Option A:</strong> \(\mathbf{A}\) is not correct but \(\mathbf{R}\) is correct.</p>
<p>This option is correct because Assertion A is incorrect while Reason R is correct.</p>
<p><strong>Option B:</strong> \(\mathbf{A}\) is correct but \(\mathbf{R}\) is not correct.</p>
<p>This option is incorrect because Assertion A is not correct.</p>
<p><strong>Option C:</strong> Both \(\mathbf{A}\) and \(\mathbf{R}\) are correct and \(\mathbf{R}\) is the correct explanation of \(\mathbf{A}\).</p>
<p>This option is incorrect because Assertion A is not correct.</p>
<p><strong>Option D:</strong> Both \(\mathbf{A}\) and \(\mathbf{R}\) are correct and \(\mathbf{R}\) is NOT the correct explanation of \(\mathbf{A}\).</p>
<p>This option is incorrect because Assertion A is not correct.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:</p>
<p><strong>Option A:</strong> \(\mathbf{A}\) is not correct but \(\mathbf{R}\) is correct.</p></li><li><strong>Q4:</strong> <b>Statement I</b> is correct as stopping potential is
independent of power of light used.<br/><br/>
<b>Statement II</b> is correct as maximum kinetic energy
of photoelectron depends on wavelength of light.</li><li><strong>Q5:</strong> (A) From Einstein's equation
<br/><br/>
\(
K_{\max }=e V_{s}=h v-\phi
\)
<br/><br/>
Form the stopping potential \(\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{s}}\right)\) depends on \(\phi\) \(\&amp; \,v\).
<br/><br/>
(B) Saturation current is proportional to intensity, i.e., number of incident photons.
<br/><br/>
(C) \(K_{\max }\) only depends on nature of photon and \(\phi\).
<br/><br/>
(D) Einstein used particle behaviour of photon to explain photon electric effect.
<br/><br/>
Only B is correct.</li><li><strong>Q6:</strong> Now let's analyze both statements:
<br/><br/>
Statement I is correct. According to the photoelectric effect, the ability to emit electrons from a metallic surface depends on the energy of the incident light. The energy of a photon is given by \(E = h\nu\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(\nu\) is the frequency of the light. Ultraviolet rays have higher frequencies and thus higher energies compared to microwaves and infrared rays, making them more effective for the emission of electrons from a metallic surface.
<br/><br/>
Statement II is incorrect. The maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons is given by \(K_{max} = h\nu - h\nu_0\), where \(\nu_0\) is the threshold frequency. This equation shows that the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons is directly proportional to the frequency of the incident light (above the threshold frequency), not inversely proportional.
<br/><br/>
Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:
<br/><br/>
Statement I is true, and Statement II is false.</li><li><strong>Q7:</strong> <p>The photoelectric effect is the phenomenon of emission of electrons (or photoelectrons) from the surface of a metal when it is illuminated by light of sufficient energy. The observations from the photoelectric effect led to the development of quantum theory. </p>
<p>According to the principles of the photoelectric effect:</p>
<p>A. The photocurrent (number of photoelectrons ejected per unit time) is indeed proportional to the intensity of the incident radiation. More intense light means more photons hitting the surface and thus more electrons being ejected.</p>
<p>B. The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons does not depend on the intensity of the incident light but rather on its frequency. Increasing the intensity of light increases the number of photoelectrons (current) but does not increase their maximum kinetic energy. </p>
<p>C. The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons does indeed depend on the frequency of the incident light. If the frequency of the incident light is below a certain threshold frequency specific to the metal, no photoelectrons are emitted regardless of the intensity of the light. Above this threshold, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons increases linearly with the frequency of the light.</p>
<p>D. The emission of photoelectrons does not require a minimum threshold intensity of incident radiation, but rather a minimum threshold frequency. </p>
<p>E. The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is not independent of the frequency of the incident light, but rather depends on it.</p>
<p>Therefore, only statements A and C are correct.</p>
</li><li><strong>Q8:</strong> <p>When energy of incident radiation is equal to the work function of the metal, then the KE of photoelectrons would be zero. But this statement does not comment on the situation when energy is less than the work function.</p></li><li><strong>Q9:</strong> <p>\(\because\) \({1 \over 2}mv_m^2 = h\nu  - \phi \)</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow v_m^2\) varies linearly with frequency.</p>
<p>And, threshold wavelength can be explained by particle nature of light.</p></li>

<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c10">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p>Let's break down the problem step by step.</p>
<p><p>The photoelectric equation is given by:</p>
<p>\(K_{\text{max}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} - \phi\)</p>
<p>where:</p></p>
<p><p>\(K_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons.</p></p>
<p><p>\(\frac{hc}{\lambda}\) is the energy of the incident photon.</p></p>
<p><p>\(\phi\) is the work function of the metal.</p></p>
<p><p>For the initial light source of wavelength \(\lambda\), we know:</p>
<p>\(2 \text{ eV} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} - 1 \text{ eV}\)</p>
<p>Solving for \(\frac{hc}{\lambda}\) gives:</p>
<p>\(\frac{hc}{\lambda} = 2 \text{ eV} + 1 \text{ eV} = 3 \text{ eV}\)</p></p>
<p><p>Now, if the wavelength is halved to \(\frac{\lambda}{2}\), the photon energy becomes:</p>
<p>\(\frac{hc}{\lambda/2} = \frac{2hc}{\lambda} = 2 \times 3 \text{ eV} = 6 \text{ eV}\)</p></p>
<p><p>The maximum kinetic energy for the new wavelength is then:</p>
<p>\(K'_{\text{max}} = 6 \text{ eV} - 1 \text{ eV} = 5 \text{ eV}\)</p></p>
<p>Therefore, the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons when the surface is illuminated by a light source of wavelength \(\frac{\lambda}{2}\) is 5 eV.</p>
<p>The correct answer is Option A.</p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> <p>Let's break down the problem step by step:</p>
<p><p>In the photoelectric effect, the energy of a photon is given by:</p>
<p>\( h\nu = \phi + K_e \)</p>
<p>where:</p></p>
<p><p>\(\phi\) is the work function of the metal,</p></p>
<p><p>\(K_e\) is the kinetic energy of the ejected electron.</p></p>
<p><p>The kinetic energy of the ejected electrons is provided by the stopping potential:</p>
<p>\( K_e = eV \)</p>
<p>Given that the stopping potential is \( V = 2 \text{ V} \), we have:</p>
<p>\( K_e = 2 \text{ eV} \)</p></p>
<p><p>Now, we can calculate the photon energy:</p>
<p>\( h\nu = \phi + K_e = 2.14 \text{ eV} + 2 \text{ eV} = 4.14 \text{ eV} \)</p></p>
<p><p>The relation between the photon's energy and its wavelength is:</p>
<p>\( h\nu = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \)</p>
<p>Rearranging for \(\lambda\):</p>
<p>\( \lambda = \frac{hc}{h\nu} \)</p></p>
<p><p>Given that \( hc = 1242 \text{ eV·nm} \), substitute the values:</p>
<p>\( \lambda = \frac{1242 \text{ eV·nm}}{4.14 \text{ eV}} \)</p></p>
<p><p>Calculate the wavelength:</p>
<p>\( \lambda \approx \frac{1242}{4.14} \approx 300 \text{ nm} \)</p></p>
<p>Thus, the wavelength of the incident electromagnetic wave is approximately 300 nm.</p>
<p>The correct answer is Option C: 300 nm.</p></li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> <p>To determine which color of visible light will cause the emission of photoelectrons from a metal with a work function of 3 eV, we need to consider the relationship between the photon energy, the work function, and the wavelength of light.</p>
<p>The maximum kinetic energy (\( \text{KE}_{\max} \)) of the emitted photoelectrons is given by:</p>
<p>\( \text{KE}_{\max} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} - \phi \)</p>
<p>For photoemission to occur, the energy of the incident photons must be greater than the work function (\(\phi\)):</p>
<p>\( \frac{hc}{\lambda} &gt; \phi \)</p>
<p>This implies:</p>
<p>\( \lambda &lt; \frac{hc}{\phi} \)</p>
<p>Substitute the values \( h = 4.135667696 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{eV}\cdot\text{s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^{8} \, \text{m/s} \), and \(\phi = 3 \, \text{eV}\):</p>
<p>\( \lambda &lt; \frac{1242}{3} \, \text{nm} \approx 414 \, \text{nm} \)</p>
<p>Since the wavelength must be less than 414 nm to cause emission, we need light with a shorter wavelength. Among the visible colors, blue light has a wavelength in this range, making it the correct choice. Thus, blue light will cause the emission of photoelectrons with this work function.</p></li><li><strong>Q4:</strong> <p>\(\begin{aligned}
&amp; \mathrm{E}=\phi+\mathrm{K}_{\max } \\
&amp; \phi=\frac{\mathrm{hc}}{\lambda_0} \\
&amp; \mathrm{~K}_{\max }=\mathrm{eV}_0 \\

&amp; \text { on solving (i) &amp; (ii) } \\
&amp; \lambda_0=9 \lambda
\end{aligned}\)</p></li><li><strong>Q5:</strong> <p>\(\begin{aligned}
&amp; \text { For P.E.E. : } \lambda \leq \frac{h c}{W_e} \\
&amp; \lambda \leq \frac{1240 \mathrm{~nm}-\mathrm{eV}}{3 \mathrm{eV}} \\
&amp; \lambda \leq 413.33 \mathrm{~nm} \\
&amp; \lambda_{\max } \approx 414 \mathrm{~nm} \text { for P.E.E. }
\end{aligned}\)</p></li><li><strong>Q6:</strong> <p>To find the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectrons, we'll use the photoelectric effect equation:</p>

\(KE_{\text{max}} = h\nu - \phi\)

<p>where \(KE_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons, \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(\nu\) is the frequency of the incident light, and \(\phi\) is the work function of the metal.</p>
<p>However, in this problem, we are given the energy of the UV light in electronvolts (eV) directly, which simplifies the problem. The energy of the UV light in electronvolts also represents the energy of the photons (\(h\nu\)) hitting the metal surface. Thus, we can calculate the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectrons using the given energies directly:</p>

\(KE_{\text{max}} = E_{\text{photon}} - \phi\)

<p>Substituting the given values:</p>

\(KE_{\text{max}} = 4.13 \, \text{eV} - 3.13 \, \text{eV} = 1 \, \text{eV}\)

<p>Therefore, the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectrons will be \(1 \, \text{eV}\). The correct answer is <strong>Option B: 1 eV</strong>.</p></li><li><strong>Q7:</strong> <p>To find the stopping potential (\(V_s\)) when UV light of wavelength \(300 \) nm is incident on a metal surface with a work function of \(2.13\) eV, we can use the photoelectric equation which relates the energy of the incident photons, the work function of the metal, and the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons.</p>
<p>The energy (E) of the photons can be calculated using the equation:</p>
<p>\(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\)</p>
<p>where \(h\) is the Planck constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the incident light. Given that \(hc = 1240 \) eV nm, we can calculate the energy of the UV light photons directly.</p>
<p>Substituting \(hc = 1240 \) eV nm and \(\lambda = 300 \) nm into the equation gives:</p>
<p>\(E = \frac{1240 \, \text{eV nm}}{300 \, \text{nm}} = 4.13 \, \text{eV}\)</p>
<p>Next, we can calculate the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons using the photoelectric effect equation:</p>
<p>\(K_{max} = E - \phi\)</p>
<p>where \(K_{max}\) is the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons, \(E\) is the energy of the incident photons, and \(\phi\) is the work function of the metal.</p>
<p>Given \(E = 4.13\) eV and the work function \(\phi = 2.13\) eV, we have:</p>
<p>\(K_{max} = 4.13 \, \text{eV} - 2.13 \, \text{eV} = 2 \, \text{eV}\)</p>
<p>The stopping potential (\(V_s\)) is related to the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons by the equation:</p>
<p>\(K_{max} = eV_s\)</p>
<p>where \(e\) is the elementary charge (the charge of an electron), and \(V_s\) is the stopping potential. Since \(e = 1\) when using energy in eV and potential in volts, the stopping potential \(V_s\) can be directly equated to the kinetic energy in eV:</p>
<p>\(V_s = K_{max} = 2 \, \text{V}\)</p>
<p>Therefore, the stopping potential is \(2\) V, which corresponds to Option B.</p></li><li><strong>Q8:</strong> \(
\begin{aligned}
&amp; \frac{1}{2} m v^2=h f-h f_0 \\\\
&amp; \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} m v_1^2=2 h f_0-h f_0=h f_0 \\\\
&amp; \text { also, } \frac{1}{2} m v_2^2=5 h f_0-h f_0=4 h f_0
\end{aligned}
\)
<br/><br/>taking ratio,
<br/><br/>\(
\frac{v_1^2}{v_2^2}=\frac{1}{4} \Rightarrow \frac{v_1}{v_2}=\frac{1}{2}
\)</li><li><strong>Q9:</strong> \(
\phi=\frac{h c}{\lambda}=\frac{1240}{350} \mathrm{eV}=3.54 \mathrm{eV}
\)
<br/><br/>\(\therefore\) Only metal B will emit photoelectron.</li><li><strong>Q10:</strong> <p>Threshold wavelength (\(\lambda_{threshold}\)) is the maximum wavelength of light required to remove an electron from a metal surface, i.e., to overcome the work function (\(\phi\)). The relationship between work function and threshold wavelength is given by:</p>

\(\phi = \frac{hc}{\lambda_{threshold}}\)

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(\phi\) is the work function in electron-volts (eV)</li>
<li>\(h\) is the Planck's constant</li>
<li>\(c\) is the speed of light</li>
<li>\(\lambda_{threshold}\) is the threshold wavelength</li>
</ul>
<p>In this problem, we are given the product \(hc = 1242 ~\mathrm{eV}\,\mathrm{nm}\), and the work functions \(\phi_{A} = 9 ~\mathrm{eV}\) and \(\phi_{B} = 4.5 ~\mathrm{eV}\). Let's calculate the threshold wavelengths for metal surfaces \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\):</p>
<p>For metal surface \(\mathrm{A}\):</p>

\(\lambda_{A} = \frac{1242}{\phi_{A}} = \frac{1242}{9}\)

<p>For metal surface \(\mathrm{B}\):</p>

\(\lambda_{B} = \frac{1242}{\phi_{B}} = \frac{1242}{4.5}\)

<p>Now let's calculate the difference between the threshold wavelengths (\(\Delta\lambda\)):</p>

\(\Delta\lambda = \lambda_{B} - \lambda_{A} = \frac{1242}{4.5} - \frac{1242}{9}\)

<p>By calculating the difference, we get:</p>

\(\Delta\lambda = 276 - 138 = 138 ~\mathrm{nm}\)
<br/>
<p>So, the difference between the threshold wavelengths for the two metal surfaces is \(\boxed{138}\,\mathrm{nm}\).</p></li><li><strong>Q11:</strong> <p>The photoelectric effect occurs when light (or more generally, electromagnetic radiation) incident on a metallic surface causes the ejection of electrons from the surface. The energy of the incident photons must be greater than the work function of the metal (denoted by \(\phi_0\)) for the electrons to be ejected. </p>
<p>The energy of the ejected electrons can be expressed as the difference between the energy of the incident photons and the work function of the metal. The maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons is given by:</p>
<p>\(K_{max} = h\nu - \phi_0\)</p>
<p>where \(h\) is the Planck's constant, \(\nu\) is the frequency of the incident light, and \(\phi_0\) is the work function of the metal.</p>
<p>We can also write the maximum kinetic energy in terms of the stopping potential (\(V_0\)) and the elementary charge (\(e\)) of an electron:</p>
<p>\(K_{max} = eV_0\)</p>
<p>Equating these two expressions for the maximum kinetic energy, we get:</p>
<p>\(eV_0 = h\nu - \phi_0\)</p>
<p>We can express the frequency \(\nu\) in terms of the speed of light \(c\) and the wavelength \(\lambda\):</p>
<p>\(\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda}\)</p>
<p>Substituting this expression for frequency in the equation, we get:</p>
<p>\(eV_0 = h\frac{c}{\lambda} - \phi_0\)</p>
<p>Now, we have two cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>The stopping potential is \(V_0\), and the wavelength is \(\lambda\).</li>
<li>The stopping potential is \(\frac{V_0}{4}\), and the wavelength is \(2\lambda\).</li>
</ol>
<p>For the first case, we use the photoelectric effect equation as is:</p>
<p>\(eV_0 = \frac{hc}{\lambda} - \phi_0\)</p>
<p>For the second case, we replace \(V_0\) with \(\frac{V_0}{4}\) and \(\lambda\) with \(2\lambda\):</p>
<p>\(\frac{eV_0}{4} = \frac{hc}{2\lambda} - \phi_0\)</p>
<p>Now we have two equations:</p>
<p>(1) \(eV_0 = \frac{hc}{\lambda} - \phi_0\)<br/><br/>
(2) \(\frac{eV_0}{4} = \frac{hc}{2\lambda} - \phi_0\)</p>
<p>We can rewrite equation (1) as:</p>
<p>\(\frac{eV_0}{4} = \frac{hc}{4\lambda} - \frac{\phi_0}{4}\)</p>
<p>Now we can equate the two expressions for \(\frac{eV_0}{4}\):</p>
<p>\(\frac{hc}{4\lambda} - \frac{\phi_0}{4} = \frac{hc}{2\lambda} - \phi_0\)</p>
<p>Now we isolate the terms containing \(\phi_0\):</p>
<p>\(\frac{3\phi_0}{4} = \frac{hc}{4\lambda} - \frac{hc}{2\lambda}\)</p>
<p>\(\frac{3\phi_0}{4} = \frac{hc}{4\lambda}\)</p>
<p>Now we can write the work function \(\phi_0\) in terms of the threshold wavelength \(\lambda_0\):</p>
<p>\(\phi_0 = \frac{hc}{\lambda_0}\)</p>
<p>Substituting the expression for the work function \(\phi_0\) in terms of the threshold wavelength \(\lambda_0\) into the previous equation, we get:</p>
<p>\(\frac{3}{4} \frac{hc}{\lambda_0} = \frac{hc}{4\lambda}\)</p>
<p>Now we can cancel out the common terms \(hc\) from both sides:</p>
<p>\(\frac{3}{4\lambda_0} = \frac{1}{4\lambda}\)</p>
<p>Next, we can cross-multiply to solve for \(\lambda_0\):</p>
<p>\(3\lambda = \lambda_0\)</p>
<p>Thus, the threshold wavelength for this metallic surface is \(3\lambda\).</p></li><li><strong>Q12:</strong> <p>Frequency of EM waves = \({6 \over {2\pi }} \times {10^{15}}\) and \({9 \over {2\pi }} \times {10^{15}}\)</p>

<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c10">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p>We know, \(e{V_0} = hv - \phi \) .... (i)</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow e{V_0} = K{E_{\max }}\) (where \(\phi\) = work function of the metal and \(v_0\) = stopping potential)</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow {V_0} = \left( {{1 \over e}} \right)K{E_{\max }}\)</p>
<p>Stopping potential depends solely on the frequency of the incident light \(+(v)\) &amp; the work function of the metal, not the intensity.</p>
<p>From eq. (i), we can see,</p>
<p>\(v \uparrow  \Rightarrow {v_0} \uparrow \)</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow {e \over {\lambda  \downarrow }} \Rightarrow {v_0} \uparrow \) (as \(v = {c \over \lambda }\))</p>
<p>So, stopping potential increases with decrease in the wavelength of the incident light.</p>
<p>Hence, option 1 is correct.</p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> <p>For photo-electric effect, energy of the photon must be greater than the work function of the metal.</p>
<p>We know, \(E = {{1240} \over \lambda } = {{1240} \over {550}}\) (as \(\lambda=550\) nm given)</p>
<p>\(\Rightarrow E=2.25\) eV</p>
<p>here, \(E &gt; {\phi _{cs}}\)</p>
<p>So, \(C_S\) only.</p></li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> <p>\(\begin{aligned}
&amp; \mathrm{hv}=\phi+\mathrm{KE}_{\max } \\
&amp; \mathrm{KE}_{\max }=\mathrm{eV}_0 \\
&amp; \mathrm{~V}_0=\frac{\mathrm{hv}-\phi}{\mathrm{e}}
\end{aligned}\)</p>
<p>(A) \(\mathrm{V}_0 \mathrm{v} / \mathrm{s} \mathrm{V}\) is linear correct</p>
<p>(B) Slope</p>
<p>\(\mathrm{v}_0=\left(\frac{\mathrm{h}}{\mathrm{e}}\right) \mathrm{v}-\frac{\phi}{\mathrm{e}} \text { Wrong }\)</p>
<p>Slope \(\frac{\mathrm{h}}{\mathrm{e}}\)</p>
<p>(C) Correct</p>
<p>(D) Incorrect</p>
<p>(E) Correct</p></li><li><strong>Q4:</strong> <p>To determine the distance between points \(A\) and \(B\) (where the electron re-enters the metallic plate), we first need to understand the electron's behavior in a magnetic field.</p>
<p><p><strong>Maximum Kinetic Energy (KE)</strong>: The energy of the emitted electron can be given by the photoelectric equation:</p>
<p>\(    \text{KE}_{\max} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} - \phi    \)</p>
<p>Here, \(\frac{hc}{\lambda}\) is the energy of the incident photons, and \(\phi\) is the work function of the metal.</p></p>
<p><p><strong>Momentum (p)</strong>: The momentum of the electron is related to its kinetic energy by the equation:</p>
<p>\(    p = \sqrt{2m \cdot \text{KE}_{\max}} = \sqrt{2m\left(\frac{hc}{\lambda} - \phi\right)}    \)</p></p>
<p><p><strong>Path of Electron in Magnetic Field</strong>: When an electron moves perpendicularly through a magnetic field, it follows a circular path. The radius \(R\) of this path is given by:</p>
<p>\(    R = \frac{p}{eB}    \)</p>
<p>where \(e\) is the charge of the electron, and \(B\) is the magnetic field strength.</p></p>
<p><p><strong>Distance Between \(A\) and \(B\)</strong>: Since the electron travels back to the plate, forming a complete semicircle, the distance between points \(A\) and \(B\) is twice the radius of this circular path:</p>
<p>\(    d_{A-B} = 2R = 2\left(\frac{p}{eB}\right)    \)</p>
<p>Substituting the expression for momentum, we find:</p>
<p>\(    d_{A-B} = \frac{2 \sqrt{2m\left(\frac{hc}{\lambda} - \phi\right)}}{eB} = \frac{\sqrt{8m\left(\frac{hc}{\lambda} - \phi\right)}}{eB}    \)</p></p>
<p>Therefore, the distance between \(A\) and \(B\) is \(\frac{\sqrt{8m(\frac{hc}{\lambda} - \phi)}}{eB}\).</p></li><li><strong>Q5:</strong> <p>The threshold frequency, \( \nu_0 \), corresponds to the minimum frequency of light required to eject electrons from the surface of a metal, a phenomenon known as the photoelectric effect. The work function, represented by \( \phi \), is the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from the surface of the metal.</p>
<p>The energy of a photon is given by the equation \( E = h\nu \), where:</p>
<ul>
<li>\( E \) is the energy of the photon,</li>
<li>\( h \) is Planck's constant (\( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \)), and</li>
<li>\( \nu \) is the frequency of the photon.</li>
</ul>
<p>To find the threshold frequency for a metal with a work function of \( 6.63 \, \text{eV} \), we must first express the work function in joules (since Planck's constant is in joules per second). To convert electron volts to joules, use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \):</p>

\( \phi = 6.63 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \frac{\text{J}}{\text{eV}} = 1.061 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \)

<p>The energy of the photon at the threshold frequency is equal to the work function:</p>

\( h\nu_0 = \phi \)

<p>Solve for \( \nu_0 \):</p>

\( \nu_0 = \frac{\phi}{h} = \frac{1.061 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}}{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s}} = 1.6 \times 10^{15} \, \text{Hz} \)

<p>Thus, the correct answer is:</p>

Option C
\( 1.6 \times 10^{15} \, \text{Hz} \)</li><li><strong>Q6:</strong> <p>Since \(\frac{\mathrm{f}}{2}&lt;\mathrm{f}_0\)</p>
<p>i.e. the incident frequency is less than threshold frequency. Hence there will be no emission of photoelectrons.</p>
<p>\(\Rightarrow \text { current }=0\)</p></li><li><strong>Q7:</strong> <p>Stopping potential is independent on intensity but 
photocurrent increases non-linearly on increasing 
intensity.</p></li><li><strong>Q8:</strong> <p>Stopping potential is independent of intensity of 
light. It depends on frequency of light.</p></li><li><strong>Q9:</strong> <p>To find the work function of the photo sensitive material, we can use the photoelectric equation which relates the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons to the photon energy and the work function (\(\phi\)) of the material:</p>
<p>\(KE_{\text{max}} = h\nu - \phi\)</p>
<p>Where \(KE_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons, \(h\nu\) is the energy of the incoming photon, and \(\phi\) is the work function of the material.</p>
<p>However, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons can also be related to the stopping potential (\(V_s\)) by the equation:</p>
<p>\(KE_{\text{max}} = e \cdot V_s\)</p>
<p>Substituting this into the first equation gives:</p>
<p>\(e \cdot V_s = h\nu - \phi\)</p>
<p>Here, \(e\) is the charge of an electron (\(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\)), but since we are dealing with energies in electronvolts (eV), and \(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\), we can directly use the values given without converting the units:</p>
<p>\(\phi = h\nu - e \cdot V_s\)</p>
<p>Where \(h\nu = 2.48 \, \text{eV}\) is the energy of the irradiating photons, and \(V_s = 0.5 \, \text{V}\).</p>
<p>Substituting these values in, we get:</p>
<p>\(\phi = 2.48 \, \text{eV} - 0.5 \, \text{eV} = 1.98 \, \text{eV}\)</p>
<p>Therefore, the work function (\(\phi\)) of the photo sensitive material is \(1.98 \, \text{eV}\), which corresponds to Option A.</p></li><li><strong>Q10:</strong> Wavelength of infra-red \(=700 \mathrm{~nm}\) (minimum)
<br/><br/>
Wavelength of UV \(=100-400 \mathrm{~nm}\)
<br/><br/>
Since we need \(\lambda&lt;5000\) Å
<br/><br/>
\(\Rightarrow\) Only UV would be able to emit photoelectrons.</li><li><strong>Q11:</strong> The energy \(E\) of a photon is related to its wavelength \(\lambda\) by the formula:
<br/><br/>
\(E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}\)
<br/><br/>
where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(c\) is the speed of light. 

In this problem, we are given that an atom absorbs a photon of wavelength \(\lambda_1=500~\mathrm{nm}\) and emits another photon of wavelength \(\lambda_2=600~\mathrm{nm}\). We can use the formula above to calculate the energy absorbed by the atom:
<br/><br/>
\(\mathrm{Energy~absorbed}=E_1-E_2=\frac{hc}{\lambda_1}-\frac{hc}{\lambda_2}=hc\left(\frac{1}{\lambda_1}-\frac{1}{\lambda_2}\right)\)
<br/><br/>
Substituting the given values for \(h\) and \(c\), we get:
<br/><br/>
\(\mathrm{Energy~absorbed}=6.6\times10^{-34}~\mathrm{J\cdot s}\cdot3\times10^8~\mathrm{m/s}\cdot\left(\frac{1}{500\times10^{-9}~\mathrm{m}}-\frac{1}{600\times10^{-9}~\mathrm{m}}\right)\)
<br/><br/>
Simplifying this expression, we get:
<br/><br/>
\(\mathrm{Energy~absorbed}=6.6\times10^{-20}~\mathrm{J}\)
<br/><br/>
We need to express this energy in electron volts (eV), which is a more convenient unit for atomic and molecular energies. To do this, we can divide the energy in joules by the charge of an electron:
<br/><br/>
\(\mathrm{Energy~absorbed~in~eV}=\frac{6.6\times10^{-20}~\mathrm{J}}{1.6\times10^{-19}~\mathrm{C/eV}}=0.4125~\mathrm{eV}\)
<br/><br/>
Finally, we can express the net energy absorbed in terms of the given value of \(n\), as follows:
<br/><br/>
\(n\times10^{-4}~\mathrm{eV}=0.4125~\mathrm{eV}\)
<br/><br/>
Solving for \(n\), we get:
<br/><br/>
\(n=\frac{0.4125}{10^{-4}}=4125\)
<br/><br/>
Therefore, the value of \(n\) is \(\boxed{4125}\).</li><li><strong>Q12:</strong> <p>We are given the work functions of Aluminium and Gold as \(4.1 ~\mathrm{eV}\) and \(5.1 ~\mathrm{eV}\), respectively.</p>
<p>The stopping potential (\(V_s\)) is related to the frequency (\(f\)) of the incident light by the equation:</p>
<p>\(eV_s = h(f - f_0)\)</p>
<p>Where \(e\) is the charge of an electron, \(h\) is Planck's constant, and \(f_0\) is the threshold frequency. The threshold frequency is related to the work function (\(\phi\)) by:</p>
<p>\(\phi = hf_0\)</p>
<p>So, we can write the equation for stopping potential as:</p>
<p>\(V_s = \frac{h}{e}(f - \frac{\phi}{h})\)</p>
<p>This equation represents a straight line with slope \(\frac{h}{e}\). Therefore, the slope of the stopping potential versus frequency plot is the same for both Aluminium and Gold. The ratio of the slopes is:</p>
<p>\(\frac{\text{Slope for Gold}}{\text{Slope for Aluminium}} = \frac{\frac{h}{e}}{\frac{h}{e}} = 1\)</p>
<p>So , the ratio of the slope of the stopping potential versus frequency plot for Gold to that of Aluminium is 1.</p>
</li><li><strong>Q13:</strong> <p>Let us say that work function is \(\phi\)</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow 2\phi  = \phi  + {1 \over 2}mv_1^2\) ...... (1)</p>
<p>and \(5\phi  = \phi  + {1 \over 2}mv_2^2\) ..... (2)</p>
<p>From (1) and (2)</p>
<p>\({{v_2^2} \over {v_1^2}} = {4 \over 1}\) or \({{{v_2}} \over {{v_1}}} = 2\)</p></li>
