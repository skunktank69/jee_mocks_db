<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c10">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p>Here, we will use the concept of relative motion.</p>
<p>Let initial (at \(t = 0\)) position of both cars is x = 0 (As they cross each other at t = 0 for Ist time)</p>
<p>given : For P</p>
<p>\({a_P} \propto t\)</p>
<p>For Q,</p>
<p>\({a_Q} = a'\) (Let) (constant)</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow {a_{{p^{(t)}}}} = kt\) where, k = constant</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow {{d{v_p}(t)} \over {dt}} = kt\) (as \(a = {{dv} \over {dt}}\))</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow \int_0^{{v_p}(t)} {d{v_p}(t) = \int_0^t {ktdt} } \) [let p and Q both starts from rest]</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow {v_p}(t) = {{k{t^2}} \over 2}\)</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow {{d{x_p}(t)} \over {dt}} = {{k{t^2}} \over 2}\) [As \(v = {{dx} \over {dt}}\)]</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow \int_0^{{x_p}(t)} {d{x_{p(t)}} = \int_0^t {{{k{t^2}} \over 2}dt} } \)</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow {x_p}(t) = {{k{t^3}} \over 6}\) .... (1)</p>
<p>Now, for Q,</p>
<p>\({x_Q}(t) = {1 \over 2}{a^1}{t^2}\) .... (2) [using Newton's 2nd equation of motion]</p>
<p>So, relative position of P w.r.t. Q,</p>
<p>\({x_{P{Q^{(t)}}}} = {x_p}(t) - {x_Q}(t)\)</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow {x_{P{Q^{(t)}}}} = {{k{t^3}} \over 6} - {1 \over 2}{a^1}{t^2}\) (From (1) and (2))</p>
<p>When both cars cross each other, \(X_{PQ}=O\)</p>
<p>As \(X_{PQ}(t)\) is a cubic polynomial, so it has maximum 3 roots.</p>
<p>Hence, the maximum number of crossing = 3</p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> <p>To find the velocity of Train B with respect to Train A, we have to subtract the velocity of Train A from the velocity of Train B, keeping in mind that they are moving in opposite directions. Since they are moving in opposite directions, the relative velocity is calculated by adding their magnitudes when converting into the same unit, which in this case is meters per second.</p>
<p>First, let's convert the speeds from km/h to m/s by multiplying by the conversion factor \( \frac{1000 \text{ m/km}}{3600 \text{ s/h}} = \frac{5}{18} \text{ m/s} \).</p>
<p>For Train A:</p>
\(
v_A = 72 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{h}} \times \frac{5}{18} \frac{\text{m/s}}{(\text{km/h})} = 20 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\)

<p>For Train B:</p>
\(
v_B = 108 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{h}} \times \frac{5}{18} \frac{\text{m/s}}{(\text{km/h})} = 30 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\)

<p>To find the velocity of B relative to A (\( v_{B/A} \)), we consider the direction: Train B is moving towards the south and Train A is moving towards the north. Therefore, relative to Train A, Train B is moving even faster towards the south, we calculate:</p>

\(
v_{B/A} = v_B + v_A = 30 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} + 20 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} = 50 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\)

<p>Since Train B is moving towards the south and Train A towards the north, we take the southward direction as negative in our coordinate system for this calculation. That means the velocity of B with respect to A is:</p>

\(
v_{B/A} = -50 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\)

<p>Next, we calculate the velocity of the ground with respect to Train B (\( v_{ground/B} \)). The ground is stationary, thus it has a velocity of 0 m/s in any direction. The velocity of an object with respect to another object moving is just the opposite of the second object's velocity. Thus:</p>

\(
v_{ground/B} = -v_B = -30 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\)

<p>However, because we are considering the southward direction as negative, the negative of a southward velocity is a northward velocity. Hence we get:</p>

\(
v_{ground/B} = 30 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
\)

<p>So the velocity of Train B with respect to Train A is -50 m/s, and the velocity of the ground with respect to Train B is 30 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is:</p>
<p>Option A: -50 m/s and -30 m/s. (Incorrect, because the velocity of ground with respect to B is positive in our chosen coordinate system)</p>
<p>Option B: -50 m/s and 30 m/s. (Correct)</p>
<p>Option C: -30 m/s and 50 m/s. (Incorrect)</p>
<p>Option D: 50 m/s and -30 m/s. (Incorrect)</p>
<p>Thus, the correct answer is Option B: -50 m/s and 30 m/s.</p></li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> To find the length of train B, we first need to determine the relative velocity between train A and train B. Since they are moving in opposite directions, their velocities add up:
<br/><br/>
\(v_{AB} = v_A + v_B = 90 \mathrm{~km/h} + 54 \mathrm{~km/h} = 144 \mathrm{~km/h}\)
<br/><br/>
Now, we need to convert this relative velocity to meters per second:
<br/><br/>
\(v_{AB} = \frac{144 \mathrm{~km/h} × 1000 \mathrm{~m/km}}{3600 \mathrm{~s/h}} = 40 \mathrm{~m/s}\)
<br/><br/>
The passenger in train A observes train B for 8 seconds. To find the length of train B, we can use the formula:
<br/><br/>
\(\text{length} = \text{relative velocity} × \text{time}\)
<br/><br/>
\(\text{length} = 40 \mathrm{~m/s} ~×~ 8 \mathrm{~s} = 320 \mathrm{~m}\)
<br/><br/>
So, the length of train B is 320 meters.</li><li><strong>Q4:</strong> Let's start by converting the velocities of both trains to m/s:<br/><br/>
Train A: \(108 \frac{km}{h} \times \frac{1000 m}{km} \times \frac{1 h}{3600 s} = 30 \frac{m}{s}\)<br/><br/>
Train B: \(72 \frac{km}{h} \times \frac{1000 m}{km} \times \frac{1 h}{3600 s} = 20 \frac{m}{s}\)
<br/><br/>
To cross the tunnel, Train A has to cover a distance equal to the length of the tunnel plus its own length: \(L + l\)<br/><br/>
Similarly, Train B has to cover a distance equal to the length of the tunnel plus its own length: \(L + 4l\)
<br/><br/>
We are given that Train A takes 35 seconds less time than Train B to cross the tunnel. Let's denote the time taken by Train A as \(t_A\) and the time taken by Train B as \(t_B\). Then, we have:
<br/><br/>
\(t_B = t_A + 35\)
<br/><br/>
Using the formula distance = velocity × time, we can write the equations for both trains:
<br/><br/>
Train A: \((L + l) = 30t_A\)<br/><br/>
Train B: \((L + 4l) = 20t_B\)
<br/><br/>
Now, we can substitute \(t_B = t_A + 35\) in the equation for Train B:
<br/><br/>
\((L + 4l) = 20(t_A + 35)\)
<br/><br/>
We have two equations and two unknowns (\(L\) and \(t_A\)). We can solve this system of equations by eliminating one of the unknowns. Let's eliminate \(t_A\) by expressing it from the equation for Train A:
<br/><br/>
\(t_A = \frac{L + l}{30}\)
<br/><br/>
Now, substitute this expression for \(t_A\) in the equation for Train B:
<br/><br/>
\((L + 4l) = 20\left(\frac{L + l}{30} + 35\right)\)
<br/><br/>
Multiplying both sides by 30 to get rid of the fraction:
<br/><br/>
\(30(L + 4l) = 20(L + l) + 20 \times 35 \times 30\)
<br/><br/>
Expanding the equation:
<br/><br/>
\(30L + 120l = 20L + 20l + 21,000\)
<br/><br/>
Simplify:
<br/><br/>
\(10L + 100l = 21,000\)
<br/><br/>
Since we are given that \(L = 60l\), substitute this into the equation:
<br/><br/>
\(10(60l) + 100l = 21,000\)
<br/><br/>
Solve for \(l\):
<br/><br/>
\(700l = 21,000\)
<br/><br/>
\(l = 30\)
<br/><br/>
Now, substitute the value of \(l\) back into the equation for \(L\):
<br/><br/>
\(L = 60l = 60 \times 30 = 1800\)
<br/><br/>
So, the length of the tunnel is:
<br/><br/>
1800 m</li><li><strong>Q5:</strong> <p>\({X_P} = \alpha t + \beta {t^2}\)</p>
<p>\({X_Q} = ft - {t^2}\)</p>
<p>\(\therefore\) \({V_P} = \alpha  + 2\beta t\)</p>
<p>\({V_Q} = f - 2t\)</p>
<p>\(\because\) \({V_P} = {V_Q}\)</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow \alpha  + 2\beta t = f - 2t\)</p>
<p>\( \Rightarrow t = {{f - \alpha } \over {2(1 + \beta )}}\)</p></li>
