<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c8">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> \(\mathrm{A}_2 \mathrm{~B} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{~A}^{+}+\mathrm{B}^{-2}\)
<p>When an atom has the lowest oxidation number of -2 in a compound, it means the atom has gained two electrons beyond its neutral state to achieve this oxidation state. This is because gaining electrons makes the oxidation number more negative. In a neutral atom, the electrons in the outermost shell are known as valence electrons, which play a crucial role in chemical reactions and bonding.</p><p>In the given compound \(\mathrm{A}_2\mathrm{B}\), atom B has an oxidation state of -2, indicating it has gained two electrons. For an atom to gain two electrons to complete its octet implies that its neutral state had six valence electrons. Therefore, before gaining electrons, the atom B would have had six electrons in its valence shell to begin with. As it gains two more electrons, it reaches an oxidation number of -2, implying it now has a complete octet or eight electrons in its valence shell, but the original count of valence electrons in its neutral state was six.</p></li>
