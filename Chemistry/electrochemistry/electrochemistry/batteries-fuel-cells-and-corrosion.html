<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c15">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p>For each application listed in List-I, match it with the appropriate battery or cell type from List-II based on their characteristics:</p>
<p><p><strong>(A) Transistors</strong>: Generally use a dry cell or Leclanché cell, where the anode is zinc (Zn) and the cathode is a carbon rod surrounded by manganese dioxide (MnO₂).  </p>
<p>Therefore, (A) Transistors match with (III) Anode - Zn; Cathode - Carbon.</p></p>
<p><p><strong>(B) Hearing aids</strong>: Operate using a mercury cell. The anode in this cell is a zinc-mercury amalgam, and the cathode is composed of mercury oxide (HgO) with carbon.  </p>
<p>Thus, (B) Hearing aids match with (I) Anode - Zn/Hg; Cathode - HgO + C.</p></p>
<p><p><strong>(C) Inverters</strong>: Use a lead-acid storage cell. In this type of cell, the anode consists of lead (Pb), and the cathode is a lead dioxide (PbO₂) grid.  </p>
<p>As a result, (C) Inverters match with (IV) Anode - Pb; Cathode - Pb | PbO₂.</p></p>
<p><p><strong>(D) Apollo space ship</strong>: Utilizes a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell. The hydrogen is oxidized at the anode, while oxygen is reduced at the cathode.  </p>
<p>Therefore, (D) Apollo space ship matches with (II) Hydrogen fuel cell.</p></p>
<p>Summary of matches:</p>
<p><p>A - III</p></p>
<p><p>B - I</p></p>
<p><p>C - IV</p></p>
<p><p>D - II</p></p>
<p>This corresponds with Answer Option A.</p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> <p>Let’s examine both statements one by one and see whether they hold true for typical corrosion processes (e.g., iron rusting):</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Statement (I)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Corrosion is an electrochemical phenomenon in which pure metal acts as an anode and impure metal as a cathode."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Corrosion is electrochemical</strong> </p>
<p>True. Corrosion, especially rusting of iron, involves oxidation at one region (the anode) and reduction at another region (the cathode) on the metal’s surface.  </p>
<p><strong>Pure metal as anode, impurity as cathode</strong> </p>
<p><p>In many practical cases (e.g., iron containing small amounts of carbon or other impurities), the <em>relatively pure</em> region of the iron is more active (less noble) and tends to oxidize (lose electrons) — that is, it serves as the anode.  </p></p>
<p><p>The impurity (e.g., carbon-rich region) often behaves more nobly and thus becomes the cathode region where reduction (e.g., oxygen reduction) occurs.  </p></p>
<p><p>This difference in electrode potentials between the pure region and the impurity region drives the corrosion cell.  </p></p>
<p>Hence, <strong>Statement (I)</strong> is generally considered <strong>true</strong> in the usual context of corrosion (like rusting of iron).</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Statement (II)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"The rate of corrosion is more in alkaline medium than in acidic medium."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><p>For most common metals (like iron), <strong>acidic</strong> media typically enhance corrosion because abundant H⁺ ions (and possibly other acidic species) can accelerate the oxidation/dissolution of the metal.  </p></p>
<p><p>In <em>mildly</em> alkaline or neutral environments, metals often form protective oxide or hydroxide layers that can slow down further corrosion.  </p></p>
<p><p>While certain strong bases can attack specific metals (e.g., Al in strong NaOH), <strong>in general</strong> for iron and many other metals, corrosion is more severe in acidic environments than in alkaline ones.</p></p>
<p>Thus, <strong>Statement (II)</strong> is <strong>false</strong> under normal corrosion scenarios (e.g., rusting of iron).</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><p><strong>Statement (I)</strong>: <strong>True</strong> </p></p>
<p><p><strong>Statement (II)</strong>: <strong>False</strong></p></p>
<p>Therefore, the correct choice (matching these truth values) is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(C) Statement I is true but Statement II is false.</strong></p>
</blockquote></li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> <p>For charging of lead storage battery cell reaction is</p>
<p>\(2 \mathrm{PbSO}_4(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Pb}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{PbO}_2(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4(\mathrm{aq})\)</p>
<p>At anode \(\mathrm{PbSO}_4\) reduced back to Pb and at cathode \(\mathrm{PbSO}_4\) oxidised back to \(\mathrm{PbO}_2\).</p>
<p>\(\begin{aligned}
\because ~&amp; \mathrm{x}_1=+2, \mathrm{y}_1=0 \\
\mathrm{x}_2 &amp; =+2, \mathrm{y}_2=4
\end{aligned}\)</p></li><li><strong>Q4:</strong> <p>To determine the reaction potentials at the anode and cathode in the methanol fuel cell, we start with the given standard cell potential:</p>
<p>\( E_{\text{cell}}^{\circ} = E_{\text{cathode}}^{\circ} - E_{\text{anode}}^{\circ} \)</p>
<p>Given:</p>
<p><p>\( E_{\text{cell}}^{\circ} = 1.21 \, \text{V} \)</p></p>
<p><p>\( E_{\text{O}_2/\text{H}_2\text{O}}^{\circ} = 1.229 \, \text{V} \)</p></p>
<p>Substituting the values,</p>
<p>\( 1.21 = 1.229 - E_{\text{anode}}^{\circ} \)</p>
<p>Solving for \( E_{\text{anode}}^{\circ} \):</p>
<p>\( E_{\text{anode}}^{\circ} = 1.229 - 1.21 = 0.019 \, \text{V} \)</p>
<p>Since this is a fuel cell based on the oxidation of methanol, methanol undergoes oxidation at the anode, while oxygen is reduced at the cathode. Therefore:</p>
<p><p><strong>Anode Reaction:</strong> Oxidation of methanol occurs here, contributing to the fuel cell’s electrical output.</p></p>
<p><p><strong>Cathode Reaction:</strong> Reduction of oxygen occurs at the cathode, where the \( E_{\text{O}_2/\text{H}_2\text{O}}^{\circ} \) potential is utilized.</p></p>
<p>Thus, we verify that the half-cell reduction potential for oxidation of methanol by CO\(_2\) is indeed 19 mV, aligning with the calculated \( E_{\text{anode}}^{\circ} \). The processes correctly identify the roles of anode and cathode in this fuel cell.</p></li><li><strong>Q5:</strong> <p>The statement that is not correct about the rusting of iron is Option C. Let's examine each option one by one:</p>
<p>Option A: Rusting of iron is envisaged as setting up of an electrochemical cell on the surface of iron object. This statement is correct. Rusting of iron is an electrochemical process that occurs when iron (Fe) reacts with water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to form hydrated iron(III) oxide, which we commonly know as rust. Iron acts as the anode, the part where oxidation occurs as iron loses electrons. Oxygen, often dissolved in water, acts as the cathode where reduction occurs, completing the electrochemical cell.</p>
<p>Option B: Dissolved acidic oxides such as \(\mathrm{SO}_2\) and \(\mathrm{NO}_2\) in water act as catalyst in the process of rusting. This statement is correct. Acidic oxides like \(\mathrm{SO}_2\) and \(\mathrm{NO}_2\) can dissolve in water to form acidic solutions which can lead to the acceleration of the rate of rusting as they may lower the pH of water, thereby increasing the availability of hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) which may facilitate the electrochemical reactions involved in rusting.</p>
<p>Option C: Coating of iron surface by tin prevents rusting, even if the tin coating is peeling off. This statement is incorrect. Tin (Sn) is used as a protective coating for iron to prevent it from rusting; however, if the tin coating starts to peel off, it exposes the iron underneath to the atmosphere, which will then be susceptible to rusting. Once the protective layer is compromised, the iron is at risk, especially if the exposed parts are more anodic than tin. Tin as a more cathodic metal can even act to accelerate the corrosion of the exposed iron—this is known as a bimetallic corrosion or galvanic corrosion.</p>
<p>Option D: When \(\mathrm{pH}\) lies above 9 or 10, rusting of iron does not take place. This statement is generally correct. Rusting of iron is lessened in alkaline conditions, i.e., when the pH is above 9 or 10 because the increased availability of hydroxide ions (OH<sup>-</sup>) can reduce the solubility of iron(II) and iron(III) ions, leading to their precipitation as hydroxides rather than participating in the rusting process.</p>
<p>Therefore, the statement from the given options that is not correct about the rusting of iron is Option C, which falsely claims that a peeling tin surface can still prevent rusting of iron.</p></li><li><strong>Q6:</strong> <p>To find the correct match between List I (Cell) and List II (Use/Property/Reaction), let's first understand each item and its corresponding match:</p>
<p>List I (Cell):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leclanché cell</strong>: This is a primary cell (non-rechargeable) widely used in flashlights and other portable devices. It's not designed for recharging.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Ni - Cd cell</strong>: Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd) batteries are rechargeable and known for being used in portable electronics, tools, and various battery-operated devices.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Fuel cell</strong>: Converts chemical energy, from a fuel into electricity through a chemical reaction with oxygen or another oxidizing agent. It converts energy of combustion (such as hydrogen) into electrical energy directly.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mercury cell</strong>: A type of battery that uses mercury oxide. It's known for its stable output voltage, making it suitable for devices like hearing aids. However, the reaction described in the list II does not pertain to the mercury cell but more closely to the Leclanché cell or similar.</li>
</ul>
<p>List II (Use/Property/Reaction):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Converts energy of combustion into electrical energy</strong>: This directly relates to the principle behind fuel cells, which generate electricity through the chemical reaction of a fuel with oxygen.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Does not involve any ion in solution and is used in hearing aids</strong>: This refers to the mercury cell, which is chosen for devices requiring a stable voltage, like hearing aids, although the description about ions might be misleading. The characteristic here is about stable voltage and application in hearing aids.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Rechargeable</strong>: This trait is indicative of Ni - Cd cells, which are known for their ability to be recharged multiple times.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Reaction at anode \(\mathrm{Zn} \rightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-}\)</strong>: This anodic reaction is typical in cells like the Leclanché cell, which features a zinc anode undergoing oxidation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these explanations, the correct matches would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A (Leclanché cell) with IV, due to the anodic reaction involving zinc.</li><br/>
<li>B (Ni - Cd cell) with III, because it is rechargeable.</li><br/>
<li>C (Fuel cell) with I, as it converts the energy of combustion into electrical energy.</li><br/>
<li>D (Mercury cell) with II, by elimination and considering its use in devices like hearing aids and the slight misdescription regarding ions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the correct answer is <strong>Option C: A-IV, B-III, C-I, D-II</strong>.</p></li><li><strong>Q7:</strong> <p>Fuel cells produce electricity with an efficiency of about \(70 \%\).</p>
<p>Fuel cells are pollution free, thus, eco-friendly.</p>
<p>Fuel cells are type of Galvanic cells only.</p></li><li><strong>Q8:</strong> <p>In the cells commonly used in clocks, specifically alkaline batteries, the reaction at the cathode involves the reduction of manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>). The manganese in MnO<sub>2</sub> is initially in the +4 oxidation state, and it gets reduced to the +3 oxidation state. Thus, the correct reaction occurring at the cathode can be represented as follows:</p>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p>Option B<br/>reduction of \(\mathrm{Mn}\) from +4 to +3</p></li><li><strong>Q9:</strong> <p>Let's review each statement:</p>
<p>A. During charging of battery, PbSO₄ on anode is converted into PbO₂.</p>
<ul>
<li>This statement is incorrect. During charging, PbSO₄ on the anode (lead plate) is converted to Pb, not PbO₂.</li>
</ul>
<p>B. During charging of battery, PbSO₄ on cathode is converted into PbO₂.</p>
<ul>
<li>This statement is correct. During charging, PbSO₄ on the cathode (lead dioxide plate) is converted back to PbO₂.</li>
</ul>
<p>C. Lead storage battery consists of grid of lead packed with PbO₂ as anode.</p>
<ul>
<li>This statement is incorrect. The anode in a lead-acid battery is made of lead (Pb), not lead dioxide (PbO₂). The cathode is made of lead dioxide (PbO₂).</li>
</ul>
<p>D. Lead storage battery has ∼38% solution of sulphuric acid as an electrolyte.</p>
<ul>
<li>This statement is correct. The electrolyte in a lead-acid battery is a solution of about 35-38% sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) in water.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the correct answer is:</p>
<p>B, D only.</p>
</li><li><strong>Q10:</strong> (a) \(\mathrm{Cd}(\mathrm{s})+2 \mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{OH})_3(\mathrm{~s}) \rightarrow \mathrm{CdO}(\mathrm{s})+2 \mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{OH})_2(\mathrm{~s})\) \(+\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}(l)\)
