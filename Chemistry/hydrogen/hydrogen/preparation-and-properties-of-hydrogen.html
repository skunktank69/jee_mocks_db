<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c14">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p>The correct answer is (A) Both A and R are true but R is NOT the correct explanation of A.</p>
<p>Assertion A is true that hydrogen is an environmentally friendly fuel because when hydrogen is combusted it produces only water vapor and no harmful pollutants or greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>Reason R is also true that the atomic number of hydrogen is 1 and it is a very light element. However, it is not a correct explanation for Assertion A as the environmental friendliness of hydrogen as a fuel is not solely determined by its atomic number or weight, but rather by how it is produced, stored, and transported. The environmental impact of hydrogen as a fuel source depends on various factors, such as the method used for its production and the emissions associated with its transportation and storage.</p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> Tanks of metal alloy like \(\mathrm{NaNi}_{5}, \mathrm{Ti}{-\mathrm{TiH}_{2},} \mathrm{Mg}-{\mathrm{MgH}}_{2}\) are used for the storage of dihydrogen.</li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> (A) Hydrogen reacts with carbon monoxide in presence of cobalt catalyst to give methanol
<br/><br/>
\(
2 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{g}) \stackrel{\text { cobalt catalyst }}{\longrightarrow} \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}(\mathrm{I})
\)
<br/><br/>
(B) Syn gas is produced from coal and the process is called coal gasification.
<br/><br/>
\(
\mathrm{C}(\mathrm{s})+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g}) \stackrel{1270 \mathrm{~K}}{\longrightarrow} \underset{(\text { syn gas) }}{\mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{g})+\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})}
\)
<br/><br/>
(C) Reaction of steam with hydrocarbons or coke at high temperature in presence of nickel catalyst gives a mixture of \(\mathrm{CO}\) and \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\), called water gas
<br/><br/>
\(
\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g}) \underset{{\mathrm{Ni}}}{\stackrel{1270 \mathrm{~K}}{\longrightarrow}}\underset{(\text { water gas })}{\mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})}
\)<br/><br/>

(D) Electrolysis of brine solution produces \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\) gas at cathode and \(\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\) gas at anode
<br/><br/>
\(\mathrm{NaCl}(\mathrm{aq}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}^{+}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(\mathrm{aq})\)
<br/><br/>
Cathode : \(2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l})+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}(\mathrm{aq})\)
<br/><br/>
Anode : \(2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(\mathrm{aq}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{e}^{-}\)</li><li><strong>Q4:</strong> <b>Assertion A :</b> Isotopes of hydrogen (protium, deuterium, and tritium) have almost the same chemical properties because they have the same number of protons and electrons, which dictate chemical behavior. However, they differ in their rates of reaction due to differences in their atomic masses, which affect reaction kinetics.
<br/><br/>
<b>Reason R :</b> The isotopes of hydrogen have different enthalpy of bond dissociation due to their differences in atomic mass. The stronger bond in deuterium compared to protium, for example, leads to higher bond dissociation enthalpy. This, in turn, influences the rate of reactions involving these isotopes, as breaking the bonds requires different amounts of energy.
<br/><br/>
Therefore, the correct answer is Both A and R are correct, and R is the correct explanation of A.</li><li><strong>Q5:</strong> <p>Let's consider each statement:</p>
<p>Statement-I : Methane (CH₄) and steam (H₂O) can indeed react in the presence of a heated nickel catalyst to produce carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen gas (H₂). This is known as the steam reforming or steam methane reforming reaction and is industrially significant for hydrogen production. Hence, Statement-I is correct.</p>
<p>Statement-II : Sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) reacts with ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) to produce nitrogen gas (N₂), water (H₂O), and sodium chloride (NaCl). This is a standard reaction that is often used in inorganic chemistry to produce nitrogen gas. Hence, Statement-II is also correct.</p>
<p>Therefore, the correct answer is Option C: Both the statements I and II are correct.</p>
</li><li><strong>Q6:</strong> <ul>
<li><strong>Assertion A:</strong> The physical properties of isotopes of hydrogen are different.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is true because the different isotopes of hydrogen have different masses. The mass of an atom determines its physical properties, such as its melting point, boiling point, and density.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reason R:</strong> The mass difference between isotopes of hydrogen is very large.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also true. The three isotopes of hydrogen are protium (1H), deuterium (2H), and tritium (3H). Protium has a mass of 1, deuterium has a mass of 2, and tritium has a mass of 3. The difference in mass between these isotopes is relatively large, which is why they have different physical properties.</p>
<p>The reason is the correct explanation of the assertion because it explains why the physical properties of the isotopes of hydrogen are different. The different masses of the isotopes cause them to have different physical properties.</p>
</li><li><strong>Q7:</strong> <p>These reactions are part of the water-gas shift reaction used in the industrial production of hydrogen. The first reaction is the endothermic steam reforming of coal (carbon), while the second reaction is the exothermic water-gas shift reaction.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Carbon reacts with steam at high temperatures (around 1000°C or 1273 K) to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen:<br/><br/>
C(s) + H\(_2\)O(g) \(\xrightarrow[T_1]{}\) CO(g) + H\(_2\)(g)</p>
</li><br/>
<li><p>Then carbon monoxide reacts with steam in the presence of a catalyst to produce carbon dioxide and more hydrogen:<br/><br/>
CO(g) + H\(_2\)O(g) \(\xrightarrow[Catalyst]{[T_2]}\) CO\(_2\)(g) + H\(_2\)(g)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the first reaction is endothermic (absorbs heat), it requires a higher temperature to proceed than the second reaction, which is exothermic (releases heat). Therefore, the temperature T\(_1\) should be higher than T\(_2\).</p>
</li><li><strong>Q8:</strong> Size of nucleus is of order<br/><br/>
\(1.5 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{~m}\) or \(1.5 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{pm}\)<br/><br/>
\(\mathrm{H}^{+}\)always exists in combined form. <br/><br/>There is no relation between two statements and hence option (D) is the answer.</li><li><strong>Q9:</strong> <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>2</sup>H and <sup>3</sup>H have same atomic number but their
atomic masses are different.<br/><br/>
Isotopes have same atomic number (i.e. same number of protons)</li><li><strong>Q10:</strong> CuO + H<sub>2</sub> \( \to \) Cu + H<sub>2</sub>O (under hot conditions) </li><li><strong>Q11:</strong> Hydrogen combines with nitrogen to produce Ammonia in Haber's process.
<br/><br/>
\(\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{g})\)
<br/><br/>
In this process, iron oxide is used with small amounts of \(\mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) and \(\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\) to increase the rate of attainment of equilibrium.
<br/><br/>
Optimum conditions for the production of ammonia are a pressure of \(200 \mathrm{~atm}\) and a temperature of \(700 \mathrm{~K}\).
<br/><br/>
Earlier, iron was used as a catalyst with molybdenum as a promoter in this reaction.</li><li><strong>Q12:</strong> High purity (&gt;99.95 %) \(\mathrm{H}_{2}\) is obtained by electrolysing warm aqueous \(\mathrm{Ba}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\) solution between nickel electrodes.</li>
