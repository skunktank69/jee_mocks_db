<h4>Answer Key</h4>

<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c10">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p>According to Dalton’s theory, compounds are 
formed when atoms of different elements combine 
in fixed ratio.</p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> <p>Matter consists of non-divisible atoms.</p>
<p>All the atoms of given element have same properties including mass.</p>
<p>Hence, statements (B) and (D) are incorrect.</p></li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> <p>(A) This statement is <b>correct</b>. Line emission spectra (or atomic emission spectra) are indeed used to study the electronic structure of atoms. These spectra are produced when photons are emitted from atoms as excited electrons return to a lower energy level. Each line corresponds to a particular quantum leap between energy levels.</p>
<p>(B) This statement is <b>incorrect</b>. The emission spectra of atoms in the gas phase do not show a continuous spread of wavelength from red to violet. Instead, they show distinct lines corresponding to specific electron transitions, hence they are known as line emission spectra.</p>
<p>(C) This statement is <b>correct</b>. An absorption spectrum is like the photographic negative of an emission spectrum. In an absorption spectrum, light passes through a cold, dilute gas and atoms in the gas absorb at characteristic frequencies; since the re-emitted light is unlikely to be emitted in the same direction as the absorbed photon, this gives rise to dark lines (absence of light) in the spectrum.</p>
<p>(D) This statement is <b>correct</b>. The element helium was indeed discovered in the sun through spectroscopy before it was found on Earth. The name helium comes from Helios, the Greek name for the sun.</p>
<p>So, the number of incorrect statements is 1.</p>
