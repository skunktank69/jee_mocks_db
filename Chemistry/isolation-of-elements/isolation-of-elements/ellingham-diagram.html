<h4>Answer Key</h4>
<ol class="c9" style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>Q1: <strong>A</strong></li><li>Q2: <strong>C</strong></li><li>Q3: <strong>A</strong></li><li>Q4: <strong>A</strong></li><li>Q5: <strong>D</strong></li>
</ol>

<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c10">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> \(
2 \mathrm{C}(\mathrm{s})+\mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{g})
\)
<br/><br/>\(\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} \mathrm{S}^0\) is \(+v e, \Delta_{\mathrm{r}} \mathrm{G}^0=\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} \mathrm{H}^0-\mathrm{T} \Delta_{\mathrm{r}} \mathrm{S}^0\);
<br/><br/>Thus slope is negative.

<br/><br/>As temperature increases \(\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} G^{\mathrm{o}}\) becomes more negative thus it has lower tendency to get decomposed.</li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> <p><b>Statement I is correct</b>, Ellingham diagram can be constructed for formation of oxides, sulphides and halides of metals. (As per NCERT)</p>
<p><b>Statement II is incorrect</b> because Ellingham diagram consists of \(\Delta_t G^0\) vs \(T\) for formation of oxides of elements.</p></li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> In the Ellingham diagram, a sharp change in slope of the line is observed for \(\mathrm{Mg}-\mathrm{MgO}\) at \(\sim 1120^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) because that is the boiling point of magnesium.<br/><br/>
There is a large increase in entropy associated with the change of state of magnesium. So, both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and (R) is the correct explanation of \((A)\).</li><li><strong>Q4:</strong> <p>The Ellingham diagram is a graphical representation of the Gibbs Free Energy change of various reactions, mainly reduction reactions of metal oxides to the metal. The temperature is plotted on the x-axis, and the Gibbs Free Energy per mole of O<sub>2</sub> is plotted on the y-axis.</p>
<p>In the Ellingham diagram, each reaction's line has a positive slope because the entropy change for the reactions is positive (we're converting a solid and a gas into more moles of gas), and the Gibbs free energy change, ΔG, is given by ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. Therefore, the ΔG becomes more negative as T increases.</p>
<p>It's important to note that a more negative ΔG indicates a more spontaneous reaction, i.e., the reaction is more likely to occur. Thus, substances lower on the Ellingham diagram are more likely to reduce the substances above them.</p>
<p>In the diagram provided, the line for C is below the line for FeO at 600°C. This implies that Carbon can reduce Iron(II) oxide to Iron at this temperature. </p>
<p>Therefore, the statement "At \(600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{C}\) can reduce \(\mathrm{FeO}\)" is correct.</p>
</li><li><strong>Q5:</strong> Ellingham diagram is plot of \(\Delta \)G vs T.
The criterion for the feasibility of a thermal
reduction is that at a given temperature Gibbs
energy change of a reaction must be negative. The
change in Gibbs energy, \(\Delta \)G for any process at any
specified temperature is given by the equation<br/><br/>
\(\Delta \)G = \(\Delta \)H - T\(\Delta \)S<br/><br/>
where \(\Delta \)H = enthalpy change and \(\Delta \)S = entropy change<br/><br/>
According to the ellingham diagram, any metal
oxide with higher \(\Delta \)G° has a tendency of getting
reduced by the metal whose metal oxide has lower
value of \(\Delta \)G°.</li>
