<h4>Explanations</h4>
<ol class="c10">
<li><strong>Q1:</strong> <p>To determine the percentage of nitrogen using the Kjeldahl's method, we first need to find out how much ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) was produced and then calculate the equivalent amount of nitrogen in the sample.</p>
<p>The ammonia released reacts with sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) in the following stoichiometry :</p>

\( 2 \mathrm{NH}_3 + \mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4 \rightarrow (\mathrm{NH}_4)_2 \mathrm{SO}_4 \)

<p>Each mole of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> reacts with 2 moles of NH<sub>3</sub>. Since 10 mL of 2 M sulfuric acid is neutralized by the ammonia, we can calculate the amount (in moles) of ammonia :</p>

\( n(\mathrm{NH}_3) = 2 \times n(\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4) \)

<p>Now calculate the moles of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> used :</p>
<p>\( n(\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4) = M \times V \)</p>
<p>\( n(\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4) = 2 \, \mathrm{M} \times 10 \, \mathrm{mL} \times \frac{1 \, \mathrm{L}}{1000\,\mathrm{mL}} \)</p>
<p>\( n(\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4) = 0.02 \, \mathrm{mol} \)</p>
<p>Therefore, the number of moles of NH<sub>3</sub> released will be twice that of the moles of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> neutralized :</p>
<p>\( n(\mathrm{NH}_3) = 2 \times 0.02 \, \mathrm{mol} \)</p>
<p>\( n(\mathrm{NH}_3) = 0.04 \, \mathrm{mol} \)
</p>
<p>Next, we use the molar mass of nitrogen (14 g/mol) to find the mass of nitrogen :</p>
<p>\( m(N) = n(N) \times M(N) \)</p>
<p>\( m(N) = 0.04 \, \mathrm{mol} \times 14 \, \mathrm{g/mol} \)</p>
<p>\( m(N) = 0.56 \, \mathrm{g} \)</p>
<p>To find the percentage of nitrogen in the compound, we take the mass of nitrogen divided by the mass of the original sample and multiply by 100% :</p>
<p>\( \mathrm{Percent \, nitrogen} = \left( \frac{m(N)}{m(\mathrm{sample})} \right) \times 100\% \)</p>
<p>\( \mathrm{Percent \, nitrogen} = \left( \frac{0.56\, \mathrm{g}}{1\, \mathrm{g}} \right) \times 100\% \)</p>
<p>\( \mathrm{Percent \, nitrogen} = 56\% \)
</p>
<p>The percentage of nitrogen in the compound is 56%.</p></li><li><strong>Q2:</strong> <p>Let's examine each statement one by one to choose the most appropriate answer :</p>
<p><b>Statement (I) : Potassium hydrogen phthalate is a primary standard for standardisation of sodium hydroxide solution.</b></p>
<p>This statement is correct. Potassium hydrogen phthalate (often abbreviated as KHP, with the chemical formula \( C_8H_5KO_4 \)) is commonly used as a primary standard in titrations because it is pure, stable, non-hygroscopic, and has a high molar mass. It reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in a stoichiometric reaction, where one mole of KHP reacts with one mole of NaOH. The equation for the reaction is as follows :</p>
<p>\( C_8H_5KO_4 + NaOH \rightarrow C_8H_4KO_4Na + H_2O \)</p>
<p><b>Statement (II) : In this titration phenolphthalein can be used as indicator.</b></p>
<p>This statement is also correct. Phenolphthalein is a suitable indicator for the titration between KHP and NaOH. It changes color in the pH range of about 8.2 to 10, which is appropriate for the endpoint of a titration involving a weak acid (KHP) and a strong base (NaOH). In an acidic solution, phenolphthalein is colorless, but it turns pink in a basic solution, signaling the end of the titration when slight excess NaOH is present.</p>
<p>Given that both statements are correct, the most appropriate answer is :</p>
<ul>
<li>Option A : Both Statement I and Statement II are correct.</li>
</ul></li><li><strong>Q3:</strong> <p>Let's evaluate each statement to identify the incorrect ones regarding the primary standard in titrimetric analysis:</p>
<p>(A) It should be purely available in dry form.</p>
<p>This statement is generally correct. A primary standard should be pure and available in a stable, dry form to ensure accurate weight measurements.</p>
<p>(B) It should not undergo chemical change in air.</p>
<p>This statement is also correct. A primary standard should be stable in air and not react with components of the atmosphere such as oxygen or carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>(C) It should be hygroscopic and should react with another chemical instantaneously and stoichiometrically.</p>
<p>This statement is incorrect. A primary standard should not be hygroscopic (it should not absorb moisture from the air) because hygroscopic substances cannot maintain a constant weight. The part about reacting stoichiometrically and instantaneously is generally correct, but being hygroscopic disqualifies a substance from being a primary standard.</p>
<p>(D) It should be readily soluble in water.</p>
<p>This statement is correct. A primary standard should be soluble in water to ensure that it can be dissolved to make a standard solution for titration.</p>
<p>(E) \(\mathrm{KMnO}_4\) &amp; \(\mathrm{NaOH}\) can be used as primary standard.</p>
<p>This statement is incorrect. Both \(\mathrm{KMnO}_4\) (potassium permanganate) and \(\mathrm{NaOH}\) (sodium hydroxide) are not suitable as primary standards. \(\mathrm{KMnO}_4\) is unstable and can decompose, while \(\mathrm{NaOH}\) is hygroscopic, which makes precise weight measurements difficult.</p>
<p>Hence, the correct answer is:</p>
<p>Option A</p>
<p>(C) and (E) only</p></li><li><strong>Q4:</strong> The balanced redox equation considering the ferrous ammonium sulfate hexahydrate is as follows:
<br/><br/>
\(
10\left[\mathrm{FeSO}_4 \cdot\left(\mathrm{NH}_4\right)_2 \mathrm{SO}_4 \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}\right]+2 \mathrm{KMnO}_4+8 \mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4 \rightarrow 
\)<br/><br/>
     \(5 \mathrm{Fe}_2\left(\mathrm{SO}_4\right)_3+2 \mathrm{MnSO}_4+10\left(\mathrm{NH}_4\right)_2 \mathrm{SO}_4+\mathrm{K}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4+68 \mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}\)
<br/><br/>
Now, we are asked to find the number of water molecules produced for 2 molecules of KMnO₄.
<br/><br/>
From the balanced equation, we can observe that 2 moles of KMnO₄ produce 68 moles of H₂O. Therefore, for 2 molecules of KMnO₄, the number of water molecules produced will be:
<br/><br/>
2 molecules × 34 water molecules per molecule of KMnO₄ = 68 water molecules
<br/><br/>
So, 68 water molecules are produced for 2 molecules of KMnO₄ in this titration.</li><li><strong>Q5:</strong> <p><b>Statement I</b>: Potassium dichromate (K\(_2\)Cr\(_2\)O\(_7\)) is indeed commonly used as a primary standard in volumetric (titrimetric) analysis. It is a powerful oxidizing agent and has a high equivalent weight. Furthermore, it is readily available, it can be obtained in a high state of purity, it is not hygroscopic, and its solutions are stable. However, the reason it is preferred over sodium dichromate (Na\(_2\)Cr\(_2\)O\(_7\)) is not due to its solubility, but rather its stability and molar mass.</p>
<p><b>Statement II</b>: Typically, the solubility of salts increases with the size of the cation. Sodium ions (Na\(^+\)) are smaller than potassium ions (K\(^+\)), so sodium salts tend to be more soluble in water than corresponding potassium salts. Thus, we would expect sodium dichromate (Na\(_2\)Cr\(_2\)O\(_7\)) to be more soluble in water than potassium dichromate (K\(_2\)Cr\(_2\)O\(_7\)).</p>
<p>Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Statement I is true but Statement II is false.</p>
</li><li><strong>Q6:</strong> <p><b>Statement I</b>: Methyl orange is a weak base, not a weak acid.</p>
<p>This is because Methyl orange is actually a pH indicator commonly used in titrations. In its deprotonated form, it appears yellow, and in its protonated form, it appears red. Methyl orange has the ability to accept a proton (\(H^+\)) from water (a characteristic of a base) and is therefore considered a weak base. </p>
<p>Chemically, this can be represented as:</p>
<p>\(\text{MO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightharpoons \text{MOH} + \text{OH}^-\)</p>
<p>Here, \(\text{MO}^-\) is the methyl orange anion, \(\text{MOH}\) is the protonated form of methyl orange, and \(\text{OH}^-\) is the hydroxide ion. </p>
<p><b>Statement II</b>: The quinonoid form of methyl orange is more intensely colored than the benzenoid form.</p>
<p>Methyl orange exists in two resonance forms: a benzenoid form (yellow) and a quinonoid form (red). In acidic solution, the equilibrium shifts towards the quinonoid form, which is red and more intensely colored than the yellow benzenoid form.</p>
<p>The equilibrium can be represented as follows:</p>
<p>Yellow Benzenoid form \(\leftrightharpoons\) Red Quinonoid form</p>
<p>In conclusion, both statements are incorrect. Methyl orange is a weak base and the quinonoid form is more intensely colored. So, the correct answer is option A. Both Statement I and <b>Statement II</b> are incorrect.</p>
</li><li><strong>Q7:</strong> <p>First Step :</p>
<p>MnO<sub>2</sub> + 4HCl \(\to\) MnCl<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
<p>Here 1 mol of MnO<sub>2</sub> produce 1 mol of Cl<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>\(\therefore\) Mole ratio of \({n_{Mn{O_2}}}:{n_{C{l_2}}} = 1:1\)</p>
<p>Second Step :</p>
<p>Cl<sub>2</sub> + 2KI \(\to\) 2KCl + I<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>Here, 1 mol of Cl<sub>2</sub> produce 1 mol of I<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>Mole ratio of \({n_{C{l_2}}}:{n_{{I_2}}} = 1:1\)</p>
<p>Third Step :</p>
<p>I<sub>2</sub> + 2Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> \(\to\) 2NaI + Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></p>
<p>1 mol of I<sub>2</sub> react with 2 mol of Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></p>
<p>Mole ratio of \({n_{{I_2}}}:{n_{{N_2}{S_2}{O_3}}} = 1:2\)</p>
<p>Given Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is 60 mL of 0.1 M</p>
<p>\(\therefore\) Number of moles of Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></p>
<p>= V (in L) \(\times\) M (Molarity)</p>
<p>= \({{60} \over {1000}} \times 0.1\)</p>
<p>= 0.006 mol</p>
<p>\(\therefore\) Number of moles of I<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>\( = {1 \over 2}(0.006)\)</p>
<p>= 0.003</p>
<p>\(\therefore\) Moles of MnO<sub>2</sub> = 0.003 (as mole ratio of MnO<sub>2</sub> and Cl<sub>2</sub> = 1 : 1)</p>
<p>Molar mass of MnO<sub>2</sub> = 55 + 32 = 87</p>
<p>\(\therefore\) Mass of MnO<sub>2</sub> = 0.003 \(\times\) 87 = 0.261 gm</p>
<p>Given MnO<sub>2</sub> = 2g</p>
<p>\(\therefore\) % of MnO<sub>2</sub> = \({{0.261} \over 2} \times 100 = 13\% \)</p></li><li><strong>Q8:</strong> <p><img alt="JEE Main 2022 (Online) 25th July Evening Shift Chemistry - Practical Organic Chemistry Question 41 English Explanation" data-orsrc="https://app-content.cdn.examgoal.net/image/1lc8kl19k/b0d01404-424e-4520-a371-1ad47687a661/fb40b280-872e-11ed-93b3-c381a41bf82e/file-1lc8kl19l.png" loading="lazy" src="https://app-content.cdn.examgoal.net/fly/@width/image/1lc8kl19k/b0d01404-424e-4520-a371-1ad47687a661/fb40b280-872e-11ed-93b3-c381a41bf82e/file-1lc8kl19l.png?format=png" style="max-width: 100%;height: auto;display: block;margin: 0 auto;max-height: 50vh"/></p>
